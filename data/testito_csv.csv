EGAS00001003736,germline mutations   transcription factor ikzf5  thrombocytopenia,"To identify novel causes of hereditary thrombocytopenia, we performed a genetic association analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from 13,037 individuals enrolled in the NIHR BioResource, including 233 cases with isolated thrombocytopenia. We found an association between rare variants in the transcription factor encoding gene IKZF5 and thrombocytopenia. We report five causal missense variants in or near IKZF5 zinc fingers (Znfs), of which two occurred de novo and three co-segregated in three pedigrees. A canonical DNA-Znf binding model predicts that three of the variants alter DNA recognition. Expression studies showed that chromatin binding was disrupted in mutant compared to wild-type (WT) IKZF5 and electron microscopy revealed a reduced quantity of alpha granules in normally sized platelets. Proplatelet formation (PPF) was reduced in megakaryocytes (MKs) from seven cases relative to six controls. Comparison of RNA-seq data from platelets, monocytes, neutrophils and CD4 T-cells from three cases and 14 healthy controls showed 1,194 differentially expressed genes in platelets but only four DEGs in each of the other blood cell types. In conclusion, IKZF5 is a novel transcriptional regulator of megakaryopoiesis and the eighth transcription factor associated with dominant thrombocytopenia in humans."

EGAS00001005039,single cell rna sequencing single cell rna sequencing  performed  13 mild moderate  10 critical covid19 pbmc samples,"Summary
Epidemiological and clinical reports have indicated that SARS-CoV-2 virulence hinges upon the triggering of an aberrant host immune response, more so than on direct virus-induced cellular damage. To elucidate the immunopathology underlying COVID-19 severity, we performed cytokine and multiplex immune profiling in mild-moderate and critically ill COVID-19 patients. Hypercytokinemia in COVID-19 differed from the IFN-γ-driven cytokine storm in macrophage activation syndrome, and was more pronounced in critical versus mild-moderate COVID-19. Systems modelling of cytokine levels paired with deep-immune profiling showed that classical monocytes drive this hyper-inflammatory phenotype and that a reduction in T-lymphocytes correlates with disease severity, with CD8+ cells being disproportionately affected. Expression of antigen presenting machinery was also reduced in critical disease.  Furthermore, we found that neutrophils contributed to disease severity and local tissue damage by amplification of hypercytokinemia and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. Together these findings suggest a myeloid-driven immunopathology, in which hyperactivated neutrophils and an ineffective adaptive immune system act as mediators of COVID-19 disease severity."

EGAS00001004997,clinical outcomes  ctdna positive urothelial carcinoma patients treated  adjuvant immunotherapy,"Minimally invasive approaches to detect residual disease after surgery are urgently needed to select patients at highest risk for metastatic relapse for additional therapies. Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) holds promise as a biomarker for molecular residual disease (MRD) and relapse,1-3 but its clinical value has yet to be demonstrated in a randomised clinical trial. We evaluated outcomes in post-surgical ctDNA-positive (+) patients in a randomised phase III trial of adjuvant atezolizumab versus observation. IMvigor010 enrolled 809 patients with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma and did not meet its primary endpoint of disease-free survival (DFS) in the intent-to-treat population. Within the study, an exploratory planned analysis of prospectively collected plasma was performed, which tested the utility of ctDNA to identify patients who may benefit from adjuvant atezolizumab treatment. ctDNA was measured at the start of therapy (cycle 1 day 1; C1D1) and at week 6 (cycle 3 day 1; C3D1), and 581 patients were evaluable for ctDNA. The prevalence of ctDNA positivity at C1D1 was 37% (n=214), and ctDNA positivity identified patients with poor prognosis (observation arm DFS HR= 6.19 (4.29, 8.91), p&amp;lt;0.0001). Here we show that ctDNA(+) patients had improved DFS and overall survival (OS) with atezolizumab versus observation (DFS HR= 0.56 (0.41-0.77); p=0.0003 and OS HR= 0.58 (0.4-0.86); p=0.0063). No difference in DFS or OS between arms was noted for ctDNA-negative patients. The rate of ctDNA clearance was higher with atezolizumab (18%) versus observation (4%) (p=0.0041). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that tumours from ctDNA(+) patients had higher expression of cell cycle and keratin genes. Within the ctDNA(+) patient population in the atezolizumab arm, non-relapsing patients were further enriched in prominent immune response signatures including PD-L1, IFNG, CXCL9, and high tumour mutational burden, whereas relapse was associated with angiogenesis and fibroblast-transforming growth factor-beta signatures (F-TBRS). TCGA molecular subset analysis revealed increased efficacy of atezolizumab in patients with basal-squamous tumours, consistent with underlying tumour-immune contexture. Together these findings suggest that adjuvant atezolizumab may be associated with improved outcomes compared with observation in this high-risk ctDNA(+) population. These findings, if validated in other settings, would shift approaches to post-operative cancer care."
EGAS00001003555,revealing active mutational processes  tumours  digipico mutlx  unprecedented accuracy,"Active mutational processes in a tumor result in genetic micro-heterogeneity that can determine the tumor’s evolutionary trajectory. Identification of these processes by studying micro-heterogeneity can unveil novel aspects of tumor evolution with potential therapeutic implications. Such studies, however, are inherently problematic because of the discovery of excessive false positive mutations. Here we report the optimization and validation of a robust whole genome sequencing and analysis pipeline (DigiPico/MutLX) that virtually eliminates false positive results. Using our method, we identified, for the first time, a sub-clonal local hyper-mutation (kataegis) event in a recurrent ovarian carcinoma, which was unidentifiable from the bulk WGS data of the same tumor. Overall, we propose DigiPico/MutLX method as a powerful framework for the reliable study of genetic micro-heterogeneity in tumor and normal tissues."

EGAS00001003772, genomic advances  sepsis gains rna seq,"Sepsis is a clinically defined syndrome for which there are no targeted treatments, in part due to extensive variation in the individual host immune response. From transcriptomic data, we identified disease endotypes, sepsis response signatures (SRSs), that are associated with differential early mortality (Davenport et al, Lancet Respiratory Medicine, 2016; Burnham et al, American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, 2017) and response to treatment in a clinical trial (Antcliffe and Burnham et al, American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, 2018) highlighting the value of molecular data for developing a personalised medicine approach to treatment in sepsis. We identified and validated these SRS groups from microarray gene expression data in a cohort of 550 patients with sepsis as a result of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) or faecal peritonitis (FP). These patients are a subset of the Genomic Advances in Sepsis (GAinS) study, an established biobank of &gt;1,300 patients with samples for functional genomics and detailed clinical information. Genotyping and proteomic datasets are currently being completed for the full cohort and plasma nucleic acids from the majority of CAP patients have been sequenced to identify the causative pathogen. We will be preforming RNA sequencing to establish informative biomarkers of the SRS endotypes and assign SRS group membership across the GAinS cohort. This will allow us to address the following research questions: (1) What are the most robust and informative SRS transcriptomic biomarkers? We have a 7-gene signature for assigning SRS group from microarray data but we need to test its robustness across gene expression platforms (notably RNA-seq as the most commonly used approach) and therefore propose to perform RNA-seq on a subset of patients with microarray data (n=100) allowing selection of the most informative gene signature set.  (2) What is the nature of differential gene expression in the SRS endotypes? RNA-seq data will allow us to determine alternatively spliced isoforms and noncoding RNAs that may be specific to SRS endotype and are not currently known from our microarray analysis. It would also allow determination of whether there are transcriptomic signatures that differentiate the pathogens causing sepsis. (3) How dynamic is SRS membership over time? By profiling and assigning SRS membership for bio-banked samples taken at different times after admission we can determine this, with implications for the feasibility of therapeutic intervention if endotype states are reversible. (4) Which genetic variants are associated with SRS group membership and can a polygenic risk score for SRS be determined to allow SRS identification in other external datasets? By assigning SRS across the full cohort we will be maximally powered for such analysis. (5) Are there potential protein biomarkers of SRS endotype? Assignment of SRS group membership will allow us to combine this information with proteomic data being generated for the full cohort. We therefore propose performing RNA-sequencing on 922 samples (run on 3 flow cells on the NovaSeq), comprising 100 paired samples with microarray data (aim 1) and 822 samples from 603 patients enrolled in GAinS for whom transcriptomic data has not yet been generated (enabling aims 2-5).  This project will be led by Katie Burnham (Davenport group) and Emma Davenport, and Julian Knight at the University of Oxford (Chief Investigator on the GAinS study) to build on an established and successful collaboration that has led to the work described above on transcriptomics and eQTL mapping in the context of sepsis.  In terms of broader impact, this work would complement two aspects of the BioAID project; firstly, the identification of SRS groups at an earlier stage in disease progression and secondly the identification of transcriptomic profiles associated with aetiology such as causative pathogen (Prelim I3253, Sandhu and Davenport). It would also lay the foundation for a proposed work package that Emma would lead as part of a Wellcome Collaborative Award application (Julian Knight lead PI). This collaborative grant would focus on immunophenotyping the endotype associated with greater mortality and therefore determining the optimal gene set to robustly assign SRS group membership will be a necessity.

Compared to wildtype cfDNA, cfDNA in Dnase1l3-deficient mice was significantly hypomethylated, while cfDNA in Dnase1-deficient mice was hypermethylated. The cfDNA hypomethylation in Dnase1l3-deficient mice was due to increased fragmentation and representation from open chromatin regions (OCRs) and CpG islands (CGIs). These findings were absent in Dnase1-deficient mice."
EGAS00000000098,metabric,"Solid tumors are complex tissues composed of a mixture of cancer and normal cells, which complicates the interpretation of their molecular profiles. Normal cell contamination can dilute cancer cell information and tissue architecture is generally not reflected in molecular assays. To address these challenges, we developed a computational approach based on standard Haematoxylin and Eosin-stained sections and demonstrated its power in a discovery cohort of  323 breast tumors and an independent validation cohort of 241 tumors. First, to deconvolute cellular heterogeneity and detect subtle genomic aberrations, we introduced an algorithm  based on tumor cellularity to increase the comparability of copy-number profiles between samples. Second, we demonstrated that a predictor for survival integrating image-based and molecular features significantly outperforms classifiers based on single data types. Third, we described and validated a novel, independent prognostic factor based on quantitative analysis of spatial patterns between stromal cells, which are not detectable by molecular assays. Our quantitative methods refine and complement molecular assays of tumor samples and could benefit all large-scale cancer studies.First, to deconvolute cellular heterogeneity and detect subtle genomic aberrations, we introduced an algorithm  based on tumor cellularity to increase the comparability of copy-number profiles between samples.

EGAS00001001561,pscp mutation analysis  hescs,"Many studies over the past 10 years, culminating in the recent report of the International Stem Cell Initiative (ISCI, 2011) have shown that hPSC acquire genetic and epigenetic changes during their time in culture. Many of the genetic changes are non-random and recurrent, probably because they provide a selective growth advantage to the undifferentiated cells. Some are shared by embryonal carcinoma cells, the malignant counterparts of ES cells. The origins of these growth advantages are poorly understood, but may come from altered cell cycle dynamics, resistance to apoptosis or altered patterns of differentiation. Less is known about the nature and consequences of epigenetic changes, but it is likely that these similarly affect hPSC behaviour; e.g., enhanced expression of DLK1, an imprinted gene, is associated with altered hPSC growth (Enver et al 2005). Inevitably, these genetic and epigenetic changes will impact on our ability to use hPSC for regenerative medicine, either because malignant transformation of the undifferentiated cells or their differentiated derivatives to be used for transplantation compromises safety, or because they impede the function of those differentiated derivatives, or because they affect the efficiency with which the undifferentiated cells can be expanded and differentiated into desired cell types. Focusing initially upon the existing clinical grade hESC lines, later moving to iPSC, we will Consolidate and extend knowledge of the rate, type and functional impact of the genetic variations that occur during hPSC culture. We will use whole genome and exome sequencing as well as SNP arrays, together with clonal analysis and other cytogenetics techniques. Common changes will be compared with those found in the normal human population, at low frequency in the original cell population or observed during iPSC generation in the HIPSCI project currently based at the WTSI. These studies will provide a better understanding of the range of genetic changes that occur in hPSC beyond the CNVs already identified. In conjunction with cancer genome resources and expertise at WTSI, bioinformatic analyses of these hPSC data will allow us to assess potential impact on hPSC behaviour pertinent to applications in regenerative medicine, notably the likelihood that specific changes arising in undifferentiated PSC cultures may be associated with potential malignant transformation of differentiated progeny.

EGAS00001004662,chromothripsis  human breast cancer hipo k26k h017 a017,"Chromothripsis is a form of genome instability, by which a presumably single catastrophic event generates extensive  genomic rearrangements of one or a few chromosome(s). Widely assumed to be an early event in tumor development, this
phenomenon plays a prominent role in tumor onset. We analyzed chromothripsis in 252 human breast cancers from two patient cohorts (149 metastatic breast cancers, 63 untreated primary tumors, 29 local relapses, 11 longitudinal pairs) using whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing. We showed that chromothripsis affects a substantial proportion of human breast cancers, with a prevalence over 60% in a cohort of metastatic cases and 25% in a cohort comprising predominantly luminal breast cancers (cohorts from HIPO K26K and H017 and A017). In the vast majority of cases, multiple chromosomes per tumor are affected, with most chromothriptic events on chromosomes 11 and 17 including, among other significantly altered drivers, CCND1, ERBB2, CDK12 and BRCA1. Importantly, chromothripsis generates recurrent fusions that drive tumor development. Chromothripsis-related rearrangements are linked with univocal mutational signatures, with clusters of point mutations due to kataegis in close proximity to the genomic breakpoints, and with the activation of specific signaling pathways. Analysis of the temporal order of events in tumors with and without chromothripsis as well as longitudinal analysis of chromothriptic patterns in tumor pairs revealed important insights on the role of chromothriptic chromosomes in tumor evolution."

Led by Mike Stratton, together with Paul Brennan, Ludmil Alexandrov, Allan Balmain, David Phillips and Peter Campbell, this large-scale international research endeavour was awarded a Cancer Research UK Grand Challenge. 

Different patterns of somatic mutation are generated by the different environmental, lifestyle and genetic factors that cause cancer, many of them are still unknown. Within Mutographs, the International Agency for Research on Cancer is coordinating the recruitment of 5000 individuals with cancer (colorectal, renal, pancreatic, oesophageal adenocarcinoma or oesophageal squamous cancers) across 5 continents to explore whether different mutational signatures explain marked variation in incidence. In brief, through an international network of collaborators around the world, biological materials are collected, along with demographic, histological, clinical and questionnaire data. Whole genome sequences of tumour-germline DNA pairs are generated at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. Somatic mutational signatures are subsequently extracted by non-negative matrix factorisation methods and correlated with risk factors data. 
Through an enhanced understanding of cancer aetiology, Mutographs unprecedented effort is anticipated to outline modifiable risk factors, lead to new approaches to prevent cancer, and provide opportunities to empower early detection, refine high-risk groups and contribute to further therapeutic development."

Distinct clinicopathological and molecular subgroups are defined by these histone mutations, with several novel co-segregating mutations identified through these aggregated analyses, including loss of FBXW7 in H3.3G34R/V, TOP3A rearrangements in H3.3K27M, and BCOR mutations in H3.1K27M. Histone wild-type subgroups can be further refined by the presence of key oncogenic events (PDGFRA or EGFR amplification/mutations) or methylation profiles which molecularly more closely resemble pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma or other low grade gliomas. The burden of genomic aberrations decreases with age, highlighting the infant population as biologically and clinically distinct. Across the whole cohort, we identify novel previously unrecognised pathway dysregulation in small subsets of tumours (e.g. splicing, WNT, immune response) which make up the umbrella classification of paediatric diffusely infiltrating gliomas. The integrated dataset helps to further define the molecular diversity of the disease, opening up novel avenues for biological study and providing a basis for functionally defined future treatment stratification."
EGAS00001002317,18  exome sequencing  radiation induced meningiomas,"Purpose: Majority of pediatric cancers require the irradiation of the central nervous system (CNS), and as more patients survive into adulthood from improved oncological therapy the sequelae of brain radiation are increasing in prevalence. Radiation-induced meningiomas (RIMs), one such secondary effect, demonstrate a clinically more aggressive behaviour than sporadic meningiomas (SMs). We aimed to describe the genomic mutational landscape of RIMs.Methods:  We analyzed a principal cohort of 18 RIMs, with 31 RIMs overall, from patients who received childhood radiation therapy and 30 SMs, as a comparator population. We performed a multiplatform integrative genomic analysis; including methylation, whole exome and RNA sequencing. Results: RIMs exhibited a five-fold increase in copy number alterations, commonly the loss of chromosome 1p (17/18 RIMs) and 22q (17/18 RIMs), which was significantly more than observed in sporadic meningiomas. Furthermore, RNA sequencing data revealed an NF2 gene fusion event in 35.3% of RIMs. In all 6 cases, there was a complete NF2 exon spliced into a complete exon of a reciprocal gene, suggesting that the breakpoints of genomic rearrangement are intronic. All tumours with the NF2 fusion also possessed monosomy of chromosome 22q, rendering the cells with homozygous disruption of NF2. Clinically, RIMs with the NF2 fusion exhibited ill-defined borders and a tendency to develop in anatomic frontal location. Also, targeted sequencing panel confirmed that RIMs had fewer nonsynonymous NF2 mutations (6.5% vs. 30% in SM) and absence of mutations in TRAF7, SMO, KLF4, PIK3CA and AKT1, genes traditionally involved in SMs.Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that RIMs have distinct genomic drivers of oncogenesis as compared to SMs, specifically NF2 inactivation through fusion event. Radiation therapy possibly triggers genomic structural rearrangements through error-prone repair of double-stranded DNA breaks."

However, their contributions to the mutation burden and clonal expansions of healthy somatic tissues are not clear. Here, exploiting the mutational footprint of some chemotherapies, we explore their influence on the evolution of hematopoietic cells. Cells of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) secondary to treatment with platinum-based drugs showed the mutational footprint of these drugs, indicating that non-malignant blood cells received chemotherapy mutations. No trace of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) mutational signature was found in AML secondary to exposure to 5FU, suggesting that cells establishing the AML were quiescent during treatment. Using the platinum-based mutational signature as a barcode, we determined that secondary AMLs began their clonal expansion after the start of the cytotoxic treatment. Its absence in clonal hematopoiesis cases is consistent with a clonal expansion that predates the exposure to the cytotoxic agent."

We identified that this excessive inflammatory response is dependent on two antibody features that are specific for severe COVID-19. First, inflammation is driven by high titers of anti-Spike IgG, a hallmark of severe disease. Second, we found that anti-Spike IgG from severely ill patients is intrinsically more pro-inflammatory because of different glycosylation of the Fc tail, particularly by low fucosylation.

EGAS00001004905,dual targeting  polyamine synthesis  uptake  diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas,"Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is an incurable malignant childhood brain tumour, with no active systemic therapies and a 5-year survival of less than 1%. Polyamines are small organic polycations that are essential for DNA replication, translation and cell proliferation. Ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1), the rate limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis, is irreversibly inhibited by difluoromethylornithine (DFMO). Herein we show that polyamine synthesis is upregulated in DIPG, leading to sensitivity to DFMO. DIPG cells compensate for ODC1 inhibition by upregulation of the polyamine transporter SLC3A2. Treatment with the polyamine transporter inhibitor AMXT 1501 reduced uptake of polyamines in DIPG cells, and co-administration of AMXT 1501 and DFMO led to potent in vitro activity, and significant extension of survival in three aggressive DIPG orthotopic animal models. Collectively, these results demonstrate the potential of dual targeting of polyamine synthesis and uptake as a therapeutic strategy for incurable DIPG."

Here, we report the first-in-human phase I study investigating maximum tolerated dose, assessing safety and preliminary efficacy of belvarafenib in BRAF- and RAS-mutated advanced solid tumors (NCT02405065, NCT03118817). Through generation of belvarafenib resistant NRAS- mutant melanoma cells and analysis of circulating tumor DNA from patients treated with belvarafenib, we identified novel recurrent mutations in ARAF within the kinase domain. ARAF mutants conferred resistance to belvarafenib in both a dimer- and kinase activity- dependent manner. Belvarafenib induced ARAF mutant dimers, and dimers containing mutant ARAF were active in the presence of inhibitor. ARAF mutations may serve as a general resistance mechanism for RAF dimer inhibitors as the mutants exhibit reduced sensitivity to a panel of type II RAF inhibitors. The combination of RAF plus MEK inhibition may be used to delay ARAF-driven resistance and suggests a rational combination for clinical use. Taken together, our findings reveal specific and compensatory functions for the ARAF isoform and implicate ARAF mutations as a driver of resistance to RAF dimer inhibitors."

Radiation-induced gliomas (RIGs) have been reported in patients after treatment with cranial irradiation for various primary malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and medulloblastoma (MB). We perform comprehensive (epi-) genetic and expression profiling of RIGs arising after cranial irradiation for MB (n=23) and ALL (n=9).

Due to the extreme difficulty of obtaining in vivo human early post-implantation embryos, the gene regulatory network and epigenetics controlling human embryo implantation remains elusive. Here, combining an in vitro culture system for human post-implantation development and single-cell omics sequencing technologies, over 10,000 single cells at five representative stages of pre/post-implantation development were systematically analyzed. Unsupervised dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithm of the transcriptome data show stepwise implantation routes for the epiblast, primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm lineages, suggesting preparation for the establishment of a mother-to-offspring connection after implantation. Female embryos showed asynchronous progress of dosage loss of X chromosomes during implantation. Furthermore, using the single cell trio-Seq (scTrio-Seq) strategy, re-methylation of the genomes of all the three lineages was unambiguously revealed. Surprisingly, the genome re-methylation of PE lineage were much slower than both EPI and TE lineages during the implantation process, indicating distinct methylome features between EPI and PE although both of which were derived from ICM. Collectively, our work paves the way for understanding the complex molecular mechanisms that regulate human embryo implantation, informing new insights and future efforts in early embryonic development and reproductive medicine."

Most of these had switched from a cetuximab-sensitive transcriptomic subtype pre-treatment to a fibroblast- and growth factor-rich subtype at progression. Fibroblast-supernatant conferred cetuximab resistance in vitro, confirming a major role for non-genetic resistance through stromal remodeling. Cetuximab treatment increased cytotoxic immune infiltrates and PDL1 and LAG3 immune-checkpoint expression, potentially providing opportunities to treat cetuximab-resistant CRCs with immunotherapy."
EGAS00001001682,tissue specific mutation accumulation  human adult stem cells  life,"Gradual accumulation of mutations in human adult stem cells during life is associated with various age-related diseases, including cancer. The number of stem cell divisions throughout life is believed to be a major determinant for mutation accumulation and could explain the extreme variation of cancer incidence across different organs. Yet, mutation patterns and rates of healthy adult stem cells remain unknown. Here, we determined genome-wide mutation patterns in primary adult stem cells of the small intestine, colon and liver of human donors with ages ranging from 3 to 87 years. We find that the number of mutations increases linearly with age up to several thousand mutations per cell at 87 years of age, while mutation spectra remain constant throughout life. Small intestine and colon stem cells have a 2-fold higher mutation rate per year compared with liver stem cells. These differences could be exclusively attributed to the mutagenic action of spontaneous deamination of cytosine residues and may reflect the high stem cell division rate in these tissues. The genomic distribution of somatic mutations is non-random and predominantly associated with DNA replication dynamics in the small intestine and colon, and with transcription in the liver. These results indicate that a stable balance between various mutagenic and DNA repair processes is maintained throughout life and that the activity of these processes in adult stem cells varies between tissues."

Here, we identify stem cell-like chromatin features in human glioblastoma initiating cells (GICs) and link them to a loss of the repressive histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) mark. Increasing H3K9me3 levels by histone demethylase inhibition led to cell death in GICs but not in their differentiated counterparts. The induction of apoptosis was accompanied by a loss of the activating H3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) modification and accumulation of DNA damage and downregulation of DDR genes. Upon knockdown of histone demethylases KDM4C and KDM7A both differentiation and DNA damage was induced. Thus, the H3K9me3-H3K9ac equilibrium is crucial for GIC viability and represents a chromatin feature that can be exploited to specifically target this tumor subpopulation."

We compared the clinical and mutational characteristics of T-MN (n=129) and primary myelodysplastic syndrome (P-MDS, n=108) patients. Although the somatic mutation frequency was similar between T-MN and P-MDS patients (93% in both groups), the pattern was distinct. TP53 mutations were more frequent in T-MN (29.5% versus 7%), while spliceosomal complex mutations were more common in P-MDS (56.5% versus 25.6%).In contrast to P-MDS, the ring sideroblasts (RS) phenotype was not associated with better survival in T-MN, most probably due to genetic association with TP53 mutations. SF3B1 was mutated in 96% of P-MDS with ≥15% RS, but in only 32% T-MN. TP53 mutations were detected in 92% T-MN with ≥15% RS and SF3B1 wild-type cases. Interestingly, T-MN and P-MDS patients with “Very low” or “Low” Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) showed similar biological and clinical characteristics. In a Cox-regression analysis, TP53 mutation was a poor prognostic factor in T-MN, independent of IPSS-R cytogenetic, disease-modifying therapy and NRAS mutation.Our data have direct implications for T-MN management and provide evidence that, in addition to conventional disease parameters, mutational analysis should be incorporated in T-MN risk stratification."

We performed deep sequencing of viral samples from patients chronically infected with HBV to investigate the association between viral genome variation and patients’ clinical characteristics. We discovered novel viral variants strongly associated with viral load and HBeAg status. Patients with viral variants C1817T and A1838G had viral loads nearly three orders of magnitude lower than patients without those variants.  These patients consequently experienced earlier viral suppression while on treatment. Furthermore, we identified novel variants that either independently or in combination with precore mutation G1896A were associated with the transition from HBeAg positive to negative phase of infection. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that mutation of the HBeAg open reading frame is an important factor driving CHB patient’s HBeAg status. This analysis provides a detailed picture of HBV genetic variation in the largest patient cohort to date and highlights the diversity of plausible molecular mechanisms through which viral variation affects clinical phenotype."

A first systematic assessment of LRS coverage showed that ~35Mb of the genome was only accessible by LRS and not SRS. Structural variant (SV) calling yielded on average 28,292 SV calls per individual, totalling 12.9 MB of sequence. Trio-based analyses showed concordance for up to 95% of these SV calls across the genome, and 80% of the LRS SV calls were not identified by SRS. De novo mutation analysis did not identify any de novo SVs, confirming these are rare events. Because of high sequence coverage, we were also able to call single nucleotide substitutions. On average, we identified 3 million substitutions per genome, with a Mendelian inheritance concordance of up to 97%. Of these, approximately 100,000 were located in the ~35Mb of the genome that was only captured by LRS. Moreover, these variants affected the coding sequence of 64 genes, including 32 known to cause Mendelian disorders. 
Although no clinical diagnoses were made in these 5 patients, our data show the potential added value of LRS compared to SRS for identifying medically relevant genome variation."

A subset of the mutations conferred selective advantages to the host cells, leading to clonal expansions and raising the risk for future cancer development. Capturing such somatic mutations in normal tissue is important to advance our understanding about carcinogenesis and could provide prospective medical insights. 
In this project, our goal is to detect somatic mutations in normal (pre-cancerous) liver tissue. Using Laser Microdissection technology, we will dissect individual liver lobules from patient samples and submit these to sequencing. For each patient sample, we aim to sequence multiple lobules to characterise the mutagenic burden. Samples will be taken from patients with different liver disease aetiologies, including alcoholism and obesity, with a view on distinguishing the prevalent mutation types occurring in each disease context.
We will perform targeted sequencing, initially using the WTSI cancer panel. Later we aim to use a novel bait set that captures both cancer genes as well as genes relevant to the non-cancerous samples (ie. genes implicated in hereditary disorders, immune sequences)."

Whole genome sequencing identified the presence of complex rearrangements resulting in a MGA-NUTM1 fusion gene in the absence of other significant somatic mutations. The fusion protein was predicted to retain nearly the entire protein sequence of both MGA (exons 1-22) and NUTM1 (exons 3-8). In contrast to typical cases of NC, these cases were successfully treated with aggressive local control measures (surgery and radiation) and both patients remain alive without disease. These cases describe a new subtype of NUTM1-rearranged tumors warranting expansion of diagnostic testing to evaluate for the presence of MGA-NUTM1 or alternative NUTM1 gene fusions in the diagnostic workup of high grade spindle cell sarcomas or small round blue cell tumors of ambiguous lineage."

Oxygen tension is an environmental cue that distinguishes peripheral tissues from the circulation and here, we demonstrate that differentiation of human CD8+ T-cells in the presence of hypoxia and TGF-β1 led to the development of a TRM phenotype, characterized by a greater than five-fold increase in CD69+CD103+ cells expressing human TRM hallmarks and enrichment for endogenous human TRM gene signatures, including increased adhesion molecule expression and decreased expression of genes involved in recirculation. Hypoxia and TGF-β1 synergized to produce a significantly larger population of TRM phenotype cells than either condition alone, and comparison of these cells from the individual and combination conditions revealed distinct phenotypic and transcriptional profiles, indicating a programming response to milieu rather than a mere expansion. Our findings identify a previously unreported cue for the TRM differentiation program and can enable facile generation of human TRM phenotype cells in vitro for basic studies and translational applications such as adoptive cellular therapy."

EGAS00001002543,pancurx translational  initiative,"The goal of the PanCuRx TRI is to seek solutions to the high fatality rate of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common type of pancreatic cancer, by generating new knowledge about the genetics and biology of the disease, mechanisms of how tumours grow and tailored treatment options.

 PDAC is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in Canada and is expected to become the second-leading cause of cancer death within the next decade. The current five-year survival rate of eight per cent is the lowest of all epithelial cancers. There are major clinical challenges to treating the disease, including the fact that PDAC spreads to other parts of the body early so surgical removal of the tumour benefits few patients, that PDAC has proven relatively resistant to systemic therapies such as chemotherapy and that there has been limited benefit from the use of newer molecular targeted agents. 

The PanCuRx team has created the world’s first resource of tumour-purified PDAC whole genomes; more than 500 PDAC samples, with combined clinical annotation, have been successfully sequenced and analyzed at the Ontario Institute for Cancer research in Toronto. The resulting clinical genomic resource created from this data has led to multiple new findings that have established a framework to better understand PDAC biology and lays the foundation for new genomic approaches to better understanding the disease. The team also launched a clinical trial called COMPASS (Comprehensive Molecular Characterization of Advanced Ductal Pancreas Adenocarcinoma for Better Treatment Selection: A Prospective Study), which is recruiting patients with advanced PDAC (both locally advanced and metastatic) at The Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (PM) in Toronto. The study uses the molecular results from individual patient tumours to guide selection of better second line treatment on a case-by-case basis. The primary objective of the initial study was to assess the feasibility of collecting tumour materials from patients with advanced PDAC and delivering results within 56 days of biopsy. Having achieved this objective, the trial has expanded to other cancer centres across Canada.
 
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most deadly forms of cancer and outcomes have not improved in four decades. The PanCuRx initiative is providing a better understanding of the disease and actively applying new knowledge to cancer patients through clinical trials. This knowledge will help to improve quality of life and prolong survival for pancreatic cancer patients worldwide."

It is thought that many common variant gene loci of weak effect act additively to predispose to common autoimmune diseases, while the contribution of rare variants remains unclear. Here we describe that rare coding variants in lupus-risk genes are present in most SLE patients and healthy controls. We demonstrate the functional consequences of rare and low frequency missense variants in the interacting proteins BLK and BANK1, which are present alone, or in combination, in a substantial proportion of lupus patients. The rare variants found in patients, but not those found exclusively in controls, impair suppression of IRF5 and type-I IFN in human B cell lines and increase pathogenic lymphocytes in lupus-prone mice. Thus, rare gene variants are common in SLE and likely contribute to genetic risk."

To date, a lifetime gluten-free diet is the only available treatment.The CeD lesion in the small intestine is characterized by crypt hyperplasia, villous atrophy and chronic inflammation with accumulation of leukocytes both in the lamina propria (LP) and in the epithelium which leads to digestive complications and higher risk of cancer. CeD is strongly associated with certain MHC class II alleles. Although activation of gluten-specific CD4 T cells is thought to be central in disease pathology, villous atrophy caused by epithelial destruction is likely mediated by CD8+ T cells infiltrating the epithelial layer. Previous studies have shown that T cells have a major role on the pathophysiology of the disease; however, the findings are mostly based on analysis of heterogeneous cell populations and on animal models.Here we comprehensively explore the cellular heterogeneity of CD45+ immune cells in human small intestine at single cell resolution using index-sorting single-cell RNA-sequencing. Interestingly we find that myeloid and Mast cell transcriptome is reshaped in CeD. We observe extensive changes in the transcriptomes of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We define a CD3zeta expressing NK-T cell population present in the control intraepithelial and lamina propria (LP) layers that is absent and replaced in CeD.

To identify potential disturbances in gene regulation, we conducted an unbiased screen of allele-specific expression (ASE) in 209 AML cases. The gene encoding GATA binding protein 2 (GATA2) displayed ASE more often than any other myeloid or cancer-related gene. GATA2 ASE was strongly associated with CEBPA double mutations (CEBPA DM), with 95% of cases presenting GATA2 ASE. In CEBPA DM AML with GATA2 mutations, the mutated allele was preferentially expressed. We found that GATA2 ASE is a somatic event lost in complete remission, supporting the notion that it plays a role in CEBPA DM AML. Acquisition of GATA2 ASE involved silencing of one allele via promoter methylation, compensated by overactivation of the other allele, thereby preserving expression levels. Notably, promoter methylation was also lost in remission together with GATA2 ASE. In summary, we propose that GATA2 ASE is acquired by epigenetic mechanisms and is a prerequisite for the development of AML with CEBPA DM. This finding constitutes a novel example of an epigenetic hit cooperating with a genetic hit in the pathogenesis of AML."

All four subunits of succinate dehydrogenase are tumor suppressor genes predisposing to paraganglioma, but only mutations in the SDHB subunit are associated with increased risk of metastasis. Here we generated an Sdhd knockout chromaffin cell line and compared it to Sdhb-deficient cells. Both cell types exhibited similar SDH loss of function, metabolic adaptation, and succinate accumulation. In contrast, Sdhb-/- cells showed hallmarks of mesenchymal transition associated with increased DNA hypermethylation and a stronger pseudo-hypoxic phenotype compared to Sdhd-/- cells. Loss of SDHB specifically led to increased oxidative stress associated with dysregulated iron and copper homeostasis in the absence of NRF2 activation. High-dose ascorbate exacerbated the increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, leading to cell death in Sdhb-/- cells. These data establish a mechanism linking oxidative stress to iron homeostasis that specifically occurs in SDHB deficient cells and may promote metastasis. They also highlight high-dose ascorbate as a promising therapeutic strategy for SDHB-related cancers."

EGAS00001003452,probabilistic cell type assignment  single cell transcriptomic data reveals spatiotemporal microenvironment dynamics  human cancers,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has transformed biomedical research, enabling decomposition of complex tissues into disaggregated, functionally distinct cell types. For many applications, investigators wish to identify cell types with known marker genes. Typically, such cell type assignments are performed through unsupervised clustering followed by manual annotation based on these marker genes, or via ""mapping"" procedures to existing data. However, the manual interpretation required in the former case scales poorly to large datasets, which are also often prone to batch effects, while existing data for purified cell types must be available for the latter. Furthermore, unsupervised clustering can be error-prone, leading to under- and over- clustering of the cell types of interest. To overcome these issues we present CellAssign, a probabilistic model that leverages prior knowledge of cell type marker genes to annotate scRNA-seq data into pre-defined and de novo cell types. CellAssign automates the process of assigning cells in a highly scalable manner across large datasets while simultaneously controlling for batch and patient effects. We demonstrate the analytical advantages of CellAssign through extensive simulations and exemplify real-world utility to profile the spatial dynamics of high-grade serous ovarian cancer and the temporal dynamics of follicular lymphoma. Our analysis reveals subclonal malignant phenotypes and points towards an evolutionary interplay between immune and cancer cell populations with cancer cells escaping immune recognition."

Here, we performed a comprehensive genomic analysis of 1,737 morphologically normal tissue biopsies (~ 600 cells each) of nine organs from five donors. We found that somatic mutation accumulations and clonal expansions are widespread, although to variable extents, in morphologically normal human tissues. Somatic copy number alterations were rarely detected, except for tissues from esophagus and cardia. Endogenous mutational processes like SBS1 and SBS5 are ubiquitous among normal tissues though exhibiting different relative activities. Exogenous mutational processes operate in multiple tissues from the same donor. We reconstructed the spatial somatic clonal architecture with sub-millimeter resolution. In esophagus and cardia, macroscopic somatic clones that expanded to hundreds of micrometers were frequently seen, whereas in tissues like colon, rectum, and duodenum, somatic clones were microscopic in size and evolved independently, possibly restricted by local tissue micro-structures. Our study depicted a body map of somatic mutations and clonal expansions from the same individuals, and it revealed that the degree of somatic clonal expansion and enrichment of driver mutations are highly organ specific."

Therefore, it is important to risk-stratify and identify STS patients who will most likely benefit from these treatments.To reveal shared and distinct methylation signatures present in STS, we performed unsupervised deconvolution of DNA methylation data from the TCGA sarcoma and an independent validation cohort. We showed that leiomyosarcoma can be subclassified into three distinct methylation groups. More importantly, we identified a component associated with tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, which suggests varying degrees of immune cell infiltration in STS subtypes and an association with prognosis. We further investigated the genomic alterations that may influence tumor infiltration by leukocytes including RB1 loss in undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas and ELK3 amplification in dedifferentiated liposarcomas. In summary, we have leveraged unsupervised methylation-based deconvolution to characterize the immune compartment and molecularly stratify subtypes in STS, which may benefit precision medicine in the future."

RAD51C promoter methylation (meRAD51C) is detected at similar frequencies to mutations, yet its effects on PARPi responses remain unresolved. In this study, three HGSC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with methylation at most or all examined CpG sites in the RAD51C promoter show responses to PARPi. Both complete and heterogeneous methylation patterns were associated with RAD51C gene silencing and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). PDX models lost meRAD51C following treatment with PARPi rucaparib or niraparib, where a single unmethylated copy of RAD51C was sufficient to drive PARPi resistance. Genomic copy number profiling of one of the PDX models using SNP arrays revealed that this resistance was acquired independently in two genetically distinct lineages. In a cohort of 11 patients with RAD51C-methylated HGSC, various patterns of meRAD51C were associated with genomic 'scarring', indicative of HRD history, but exhibited no clear correlations with clinical outcome. Differences in methylation stability under treatment pressure were also observed between patients, where one HGSC was found to maintain meRAD51C after 6 lines of therapy (4 platinum-based), whilst another HGSC sample was found to have heterozygous meRAD51C and elevated RAD51C gene expression (relative to homozygous meRAD51C controls) after only neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. As meRAD51C loss in a single gene copy was sufficient to cause PARPi resistance in PDX, methylation zygosity should be carefully assessed in previously treated patients when considering PARPi therapy."

Using single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles of murine and human tissue Treg cells, we defined a species-conserved and microbiota-independent repair Treg signature, with a prevailing footprint of the transcription factor BATF. Combining this signature with gene expression profiling and TCR fate mapping, we identified a population of tissue-like Treg cells in peripheral blood, characterized by the expression of BATF, CCR8 and HLA-DR. Human BATF+CCR8+ Treg cells from normal skin and adipose tissue shared features with tumor-resident Treg and tissue T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells.

Our findings confirm the persistence of known clinically-relevant mutations (e.g. those of RAS family of oncogenes) in CRC primary and metastases, yet reveal that latency and interval systemic therapy affect the course of evolutionary events within metastatic lesions. Specifically, our analysis of patient-matched primary and multiple metastatic lesions, developed over time, showed a similar genetic composition for liver metastatic tumors, which were 21-months apart. This genetic makeup was different from those identified in lung metastases developed before manifestation of the second liver metastasis.

The Human Cell Atlas initiative is an ambitious global research effort which aims to describe every cell in the human body across all developmental stages to generate a reference map to accelerate progress in science and medicine particularly relating to human development and disease. The initiative is led by investigators based at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and funding support from the Wellcome and NIH. This specific project will assess human development. We aim to interrogate the cellular composition and molecular regulators underpinning development and maturation through single cell RNA-sequencing/spatial transcriptomics and computational algorithms to predict cellular developmental trajectories and cell-cell interactions. We will subsequent validate these findings in situ using allied imaging technologies e.g. immunohistochemistry and RNAscope and in vitro culture of human intestinal organoids (HIOs).

These studies were performed in viral diseases where public T-cell receptors (TCR) appear to confer better protective responses. Selective pressures generating common TCR clonotypes are currently not well understood but it is believed that they confer a growth advantage. As very little is known about public TCR clonotypes in cancer, here we set out to determine the extent of shared TCR clonotypes in the intra-tumor microenvironments of virus- and non-virus- driven head and neck cancers using TCR sequencing. We report that tumor-infiltrating T-cell clonotypes were indeed shared across individuals with the same cancer type, where the majority of shared sequences were specific to the cancer type (ie viral versus non-viral). These shared clonotypes were not particularly enriched in EBV-associated nasopharynx cancer, but in both cancers, exhibited distinct characteristics, namely shorter CDR3 lengths, restricted V- and J-gene usages and also demonstrated convergent V(D)J recombination. Many of these shared TCRs were expressed in patients with a shared HLA background. Pattern recognition of CDR3 amino acid sequences revealed strong convergence to specific motifs that were unique to each cancer type, suggesting they may be enriched for specificity to common antigens found in the tumor microenvironment. The identification of shared TCRs in infiltrating tumor T-cells not only adds to our understanding of the tumor adaptive immune recognition but could also serve as disease-specific biomarkers and guide the development of future immunotherapies."

Led by Mike Stratton, together with Paul Brennan, Ludmil Alexandrov, Allan Balmain, David Phillips and Peter Campbell, this large-scale international research endeavour was awarded a Cancer Research UK Grand Challenge. 

Different patterns of somatic mutation are generated by the different environmental, lifestyle and genetic factors that cause cancer, many of them are still unknown. Within Mutographs, Kings College London will characterise the mutational signatures induced by putative human carcinogens in order to identify the origins of mutational signatures found in human cancers. To achieve this human organoid cell cultures will be exposed to a representative catalogue of known or suspected human carcinogens and mutagens and, using whole genome sequencing, the patterns of mutations induced by them will be determined. Somatic mutational signatures will be subsequently extracted by non-negative matrix factorisation methods and correlated with exposure data.

However, widespread clinical adoption of these biomarkers has historically been limited due to barriers such as evidence of clinical utility and reimbursement. We have developed 2.2 Mb targeted NGS system and an automated machine-learning analysis approach (PGDx elio™ tissue complete, ETC) that has been FDA cleared for examination of 500+ cancer-related genes and 68 mononucleotide repeats for identification of sequence and structural alterations, TMB, and MSI in solid cancers in a clinical setting.  We designed and trained this approach using sequence data from 4,174 cancers and &amp;gt;124,000 in silico alterations and evaluated the methodology in &amp;gt;2,550 tumor or non-cancerous normal samples.  Independent analyses of ETC sequence changes in 440 formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor or cell line samples using MSK-IMPACT™, FoundationOne®, and ddPCR revealed a positive percent agreement (PPA) &amp;gt;97% with high sensitivity as low as 3% mutant allele fraction.  We observed high concordance between panel-wide and whole-exome TMB for 307 pan-cancer FFPE tumors (Pearson r=0.95, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) using samples with ≥20% tumor cellularity.  Comparison of the mutation context and repeat-based MSI approach in ETC with a multiplex MSI PCR assay in 223 samples revealed a PPA of 99% and negative predictive agreement (NPA) &amp;gt;99%.  We confirmed the accuracy and precision of TMB and MSI measurements across three independent laboratories (CV of &amp;lt;5% and average PPA &amp;gt;99%, respectively). Finally, evaluation of amplifications and translocations against DNA and RNA-based approaches exhibited &amp;gt;98% NPA and PPA of 86% and 82% respectively.

To identify contributory, secondary genetic alterations in these cancers, we used comprehensive genomics methods to compare 149 HPV-positive and 335 HPV-negative OSCC tumor/normal pairs. Different behavioral risk factors underlying the two OSCC types were reflected in distinctive genomic mutational signatures. In HPV-positive OSCC, the signatures of APOBEC cytosine deaminase editing, associated with anti-viral immunity, were strongly linked to overall mutational burden. By contrast, in HPV-negative OSCC, T&gt;C substitutions in the sequence context 5’-ATN-3’ correlated with tobacco exposure. Universal expression of HPV E6*1 and E7 oncogenes was a sine qua non of HPV-positive OSCC. Significant enrichment of somatic mutations was confirmed or newly identified in PIK3CA, KMT2D, FGFR3, FBXW7, DDX3X, PTEN, TRAF3, RB1, CYLD, RIPK4, ZNF750, EP300, CASZ1, TAF5, RBL1, IFNGR1 and NFKBIA. Of these, many affect host pathways already targeted by HPV oncoproteins, including the p53 and pRB pathways, or disrupt host defenses against viral infections, including interferon and nuclear factor-B signaling. Frequent copy number changes were associated with concordant changes in gene expression. Chr. 11q (including CCND1) and 14q (including DICER1 and AKT1) were recurrently lost in HPV-positive OSCC, in contrast to their gains in HPV-negative OSCC. High-ranking variant allele fractions implicated ZNF750, PIK3CA and EP300 mutations as candidate driver events in HPV-positive cancers. We conclude that virus-host interactions cooperatively shape the unique genetic features of these cancers, distinguishing them from their HPV-negative counterparts."

In this first single-cell RNA-seq study of tetramer-sorted T cells from untreated celiac disease patients blood, we found that gluten-specific T cells showed distinct transcriptomic profiles consistent with activated effector memory T cells that shared features with Th1 and follicular helper T cells. Compared to non-specific cells, gluten-specific T cells showed differential expression of several genes involved in T-cell receptor signaling, translational processes, apoptosis, fatty acid transport, and redox potentials. Many of the gluten-specific T cells studied shared T-cell receptor with each other, indicating that circulating gluten-specific T cells belong to a limited number of clones. Moreover, the transcriptional profiles of cells that shared the same clonal origin were transcriptionally more similar compared with between clonally unrelated gluten-specific cells."

EGAS00001005396,interferon lambda 4 impairs viral antigen presentation  attenuates t cell responses,"Genetic variants of the interferon lambda (IFNL) gene locus are strongly associated with spontaneous and IFN treatment induced clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. Individuals with the ancestral IFNL4-dG allele are not able to clear HCV in the acute phase and develop chronic hepatitis C (CHC) with more than 90% probability. Paradoxically, the IFNL4-dG allele encodes a fully functional IFNλ4 protein with antiviral activity against HCV and coronavirus. Here we describe a hitherto unknown effect of IFNλ4 on HCV antigen presentation. Only minor amounts of IFNλ4 are secreted, because the protein is largely retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it induces ER stress. Stressed cells were significantly weaker activators of HCV specific CD8+ T cells. This was not due to reduced MHC I surface presentation or extracellular IFNλ4 effects, since T cell responses could be restored by exogenous loading of MHC with HCV antigens. Rather, IFNλ4 induced ER stress impaired HCV antigen processing and/or loading onto the MHC I complex. Our results provide a potential explanation for the IFNλ4 – HCV paradox."

Therapeutic attempts to extend remission and prevent relapse include the maximisation of response and use of maintenance therapy. We used whole exome sequencing to study the genetics of paired presentation and relapse samples from 56 newly diagnosed patients, following induction therapy, randomised to receive either lenalidomide maintenance or observation as part of the Myeloma XI trial. Patients included were considered high risk, relapsing within 30 months of maintenance randomisation. Patients achieving a complete response had predominantly branching evolutionary patterns leading to relapse, characterised by a greater mutational burden, an altered mutational profile, bi-allelic inactivation of tumour suppressor genes, and acquired structural aberrations. Conversely, in patients achieving a partial response the evolutionary features were predominantly stable with a similar mutational and structural profile. There were no significant differences between patients relapsing after maintenance lenalidomide vs observation. This study shows that the depth of response is a key determinant of the evolutionary patterns seen at relapse."

In the era of precision medicine, targeted therapies represent an exciting treatment opportunity, yet resistance can rapidly emerge, playing an important role in treatment failure. In a prospective biopsy-stratified clinical trial, we combined detailed molecular profiling (methylation BeadArray, exome, RNAseq, phospho-proteomics) linked to drug screening in newly-established patient-derived models of DIPG in vitro and in vivo. We identified a high degree of in vitro sensitivity to the MEK inhibitor trametinib in samples which harboured genetic alterations targeting the MAPK pathway, including the non-canonical BRAF_G469V mutation, and those affecting PIK3R1 and NF1. However, treatment of PDX models and of a patient with trametinib at relapse failed to elicit a significant response. We generated trametinib-resistant clones in the BRAF_G469V model through continuous drug exposure, and identified acquired mutations in MEK1/2 (MEK1_K57N, MEK1_I141S and MEK2_I115N) with sustained pathway up-regulation. These cells showed the hallmarks of mesenchymal transition, and expression signatures overlapping with inherently trametinib-insensitive primary patient-derived cells that predicted an observed sensitivity to dasatinib. Combinations of trametinib with dasatinib and the downstream ERK inhibitor ulixertinib showed highly synergistic effects in vitro. These data highlight the MAPK pathway as a therapeutic target in DIPG, and show the importance of parallel resistance modelling and rational combinatorial treatments likely to be required for meaningful clinical translation."

As part of the Deciphering Developmental Disorders study, we have discovered and genotyped ~10K trios (child, mom, and dad) for three types of mobile genetic elements, Alu, L1, and SVA. During the course of our analysis we identified 17 variants found in a single proband (i.e. singletons) and with low allelic depth (i.e. a low proportion of sequencing reads supporting the new ME copy) in only one parent. As part of the review process for our manuscript on MEs, we were asked to determine if some of these vairants may actually be mosaic in the parent, or not present in every cell of the particular individuals body. To determine the mosaic status of each of our 17 variants, we plan to use long-amplicon PCR coupled with Pacific Biosciences sequencing to attempt to phase our MEs with nearby heterozygous SNVs. If the haplotype carrying the nearby heterozygous SNV only supports the insertion event in less than 50 percent of reads, then our variants are likely mosaic. With this information, we can both better understand the transmission of mosaic MEs from parent to offspring, as well as potentially identify variants that had no impact in the parent but could lead to a disorder in the proband."

High frequency driver gene mutations in PDAC include KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4 which play a major role in clonal expansions during pancreatic carcinogenesis and influence metastatic propensity. Emerging data indicate the noncoding genome also plays a role in cancer. In PDAC, few studies have focused specifically on enhancer mutations. While the non-coding genome appears to play a role, the dynamic nature of noncoding alterations with respect to clonal progression of solid tumors remains unexplored.

At time of recurrence, treatment options are limited and remain without consensus. This report describes the genetic findings, obtained from whole exome sequencing of a pediatric patient with glioblastoma who underwent multiple surgical resections and treatment with standard chemoradiation, as well as a novel recombinant poliovirus vaccine therapy. Strikingly, despite the variety of treatments, there was persistence of a tumor clone, characterized by a deleterious STAG2 mutation, whose deficiency in pre-clinical studies can cause aneuploidy and aberrant mitotic progression, but remains understudied in the clinical setting. There was near elimination of an EGFR mutated and amplified tumor clone after gross total resection, standard chemoradiation, and poliovirus therapy, followed by the emergence of a persistently STAG2 mutated clone, with rare mutations in PTPN11 and BRAF, the latter composed of a novel deleterious mutation previously not reported in pediatric glioblastoma (p.D594G). This was accompanied by a mutation signature shift towards one characterized by increased DNA damage repair defects, consistent with the known underlying STAG2 deficiency. As such, this case represents a novel report following the clinical and genetic progression of a STAG2 mutated glioblastoma, including treatment with a novel and emerging immunotherapy. Although STAG2 deficiency comprises only a small subset of gliomas, this case adds clinical evidence to existing pre-clinical data supporting a role for STAG2 mutations in tumor formation and resistance to standard therapies."

Extracellular RNAs present in seminal plasma might contain biomarker potential for the accurate detection of clinically significant prostate cancer. So far, the extracellular messenger RNA (mRNA) profile of seminal plasma has not been interrogated for its biomarker potential in the context of prostate cancer. Here, we investigate the mRNA transcriptome in seminal plasma samples obtained from prostate cancer patients (n=25), patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (n=26) and individuals without prostatic disease (n=6). Seminal plasma harbors a complex mRNA repertoire that reflects prostate as its tissue of origin. The endogenous RNA content is higher in the prostate cancer samples compared to the control samples. Prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3), a long non-coding RNA with prostate cancer-specific overexpression, and ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1), known to be involved in the prostate cancer pathogenesis, were more abundant in the prostate cancer group. In addition, twelve high confidence fusion transcripts could be detected in prostate cancer samples, including the bona-fide prostate cancer fusion transcript TMPRSS2-ERG.

EGAS00001003558,colorectal cancer organoids expressing braf fusion genes,"Fusion genes may be oncogenic drivers and potential targets for personalized therapies in a variety of cancer types. The BRAF gene is frequently involved in oncogenic fusions, with fusion frequencies of 0.2-3% throughout different cancers. BRAF can be fused to a wide variety of genes, however, BRAF fusions rarely occur in the exact same gene configuration, making assessment of the fusion relevance and decision for drug treatment challenging. Here, we devised a colorectal cancer organoid-based platform to functionally characterize diverse BRAF fusions, containing various partner genes (AGAP3, DLG1 and TRIM24). We compared these BRAF fusions with respect to cellular behaviour, downstream signaling activation and response to targeted therapies. We found that 5’ partner choice of BRAF affects cellular localization and intracellular signaling capacities of the fusion genes. The DLG1-BRAF fusion gene showed distinct localization to the plasma membrane and exhibited increased levels of MAPK pathway activation under unperturbed conditions. Furthermore, the different BRAF fusions showed varying sensitivities to the targeted inhibition of ERK and BRAF, with the DLG1-BRAF fusion being the most sensitive. Additionally, RNA-sequencing identified distinct subsets of genes affected by the DLG1-BRAF fusion gene. Importantly, all fusion genes conveyed resistance to the clinically relevant EGFR/HER2/HER4-inhibitor afatinib, suggesting that BRAF fusions should be screened alongside other MAPK pathway alterations to identify mCRC patients amenable to cetuximab treatment. In summary, we developed a platform to efficiently assess molecular and cellular effects of fusion genes, and revealed that differential drug responses and distinct gene expression profiles can be induced by different BRAF fusions ."

EGAS00001003375,functional studies  candidate malaria protective polymorphisms,"The spread of resistance to drugs and insecticides by Plasmodium falciparum parasites and their mosquito vectors are hampering current efforts to control and eliminate malaria. New approaches are therefore needed. In the past, malaria genetics studies exemplified by those describing the relationship between Duffy blood group negativity and natural resistance to P. vivax malaria, have played an important role in elucidating key aspects of the host-parasite biology, thereby informing potential therapeutic targets including vaccines. In a large multi-country genome-wide association study we recently identified a number of novel malaria-protective polymorphisms, most of which were found in or near to genes that are important for the normal function of red blood cells (RBCs). The mechanisms underlying the protective effects of these polymorphisms have yet to be understood. Through this study we aim to perform a range of functional experimental assays with a view to gaining a better understanding of the manner in which such polymorphisms affect the dynamics of the host-parasite interaction and prevent severe malaria episodes. Specifically, we will investigate the effects of human genetic variation on (i) RBC structure and function, (ii) P. falciparum invasion in vitro using donor RBCs in culture, (iii) in vitro correlates of severe malaria, and (iv) transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of RBCs across genotype groups. Our hope is that findings from this study might inform the development of new approaches to the control and treatment of malaria.

To comprehensively depict and dissect the baseline landscape of the composition, lineage and functional states of TILs in lung cancer, here we generated deep single-cell RNA sequencing data for 12,346 T cells from the primary tumour, adjacent normal tissues and peripheral blood of 14 treatment-naive NSCLC patients. Combined expression and TCR-based lineage tracking revealed a significant proportion of effector T cells with common origins and similar functional states across peripheral blood and tumours pointing towards a highly migratory nature of these T cells. We also observed tumour-infiltrating CD8+ T cells undergoing extensive clonal expansion and exhaustion, with two clusters of cells exhibiting states preceding exhaustion. Survival analysis on independent datasets suggested that high ratio of pre-exhausted to exhausted T cells is associated with better prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In addition, we observed further heterogeneity within the tumour regulatory T cells (Tregs), characterized by the bimodal distribution of TNFRSF9, an activation marker for antigen-specific Tregs.

We present here a novel resource - the 3D Glioma Atlas -  in which we record the precise, three-dimensional (3D) coordinate for each of 8-20 spatially-distinct samples obtained from each patient tumor.By revealing how genetic alterations and tumor cell states are patterned in glioma in 3D space, our Atlas shows that genetic diversity is more regionally confined in indolent as compared to aggressive tumors, that recurrent tumors have a greater density of genetic diversity, and that more aggressive tumors have greater tumor-wide transcriptomic heterogeneity."

In order to comprehensively identify the mechanisms involved in MHC-I loss, we first performed immunophenotypic analysis of both MHC class-I and -II in 657 cases across the spectrum of B-NHL, revealing that loss of MHC-I, but not MHC-II, is preferentially restricted to DLBCL. We then used whole exome and targeted deep-sequencing to examine genes involved in MHC-I expression in 74 DLBCL samples representative of MHC-I positive and negative cases. We show here that somatic biallelic or monoallelic inactivation of B2M and/or HLA-I is present in 80.9% (34/42) of MHC-I negative tumors. Furthermore, 68.8% (22/32) of MHC-I positive DLBCLs also harbored monoallelic HLA-I genetic alterations (MHC-I positivemono) that lead to allelic imbalance, suggesting allele-specific inactivation. Both MHC-I negative and MHC-I positivemono cases showed a significantly higher mutational burden as well as a higher number of inferred neo-antigens, suggesting co-selection of HLA-I loss and sustained neo-antigen production. Interestingly, the analysis of &amp;gt; 500.000  individuals in two databases revealed homozygosity of germline HLA-I genes in 26-38% of DLBCL patients, a frequency significantly higher than that observed in any other cancer type. In mice, germinal-center B cells lacking HLA-I expression did not progress to lymphoma and were counterselected in the context of oncogene-driven lymphomagenesis, suggesting that additional events are needed to license immune evasion. These results suggest a multi-step process of HLA-I loss including both germ-line and somatic events in DLBCL development, and have direct implications for the pathogenesis and immunotherapeutic targeting of this disease."

Unsupervised transcriptomic analysis revealed six molecular subsets with distinct angiogenesis, immune, cell cycle, metabolism, and stromal programs. While sunitinib was effective in subsets with high angiogenesis, atezolizumab+bevacizumab improved clinical benefit in tumors with high T-effector and/or cell cycle transcription. Somatic mutations in PBRM1 and KDM5C associated with high angiogenesis and AMPK/Fatty acid oxidation gene expression, while CDKN2A/B and TP53 alterations were more prevalent in tumors with increased cell cycle and anabolic metabolism. Sarcomatoid tumors exhibited low prevalence of PBRM1 mutations and angiogenesis markers, frequent CDKN2A/B, BAP1 and TP53 alterations, and increased PD-L1 expression. These findings can be applied to molecularly stratify advanced RCC patients, explain improved outcomes of sarcomatoid tumors to checkpoint blockade, and develop personalized therapies."

Using this protocol, 101 BC organoid lines were generated, broadly recapitulating the diversity of the disease. BC organoid morphologies typically matched the histopathology, hormone receptor-, and HER2 status of the original tumor. DNA copy number variations as well as sequence changes were consistent within tumor-organoid pairs and largely retained even after extended passaging. BC organoids furthermore populated all major gene expression-based classification groups and allowed drug screens in vitro and upon xenotransplantation.

We set out to explore the interaction between host inflammation and parasite variant surface antigen (VSA) expression, asking whether this relationship underpins the variation observed in controlled human malaria infection. We uncovered marked heterogeneity in the response of naive hosts to blood challenge with some volunteers maintaining a state of immune quiescence, others triggering interferon-stimulated inflammation and a small group showing transcriptional evidence of myeloid cell suppression. Significantly, only inflammatory volunteers experienced hallmark symptoms of clinical malaria. When we then tracked temporal changes in parasite VSA expression to ask whether variants associated with severe disease preferentially expand in naive hosts (as predicted by current theory) we found that var gene profiles were essentially unchanged after 10-days of blood-stage infection. These data therefore show that the diverse clinical outcomes of CHMI largely originate from host-intrinsic variation and there is no evidence for switching or selection of var genes in naïve hosts.

Markers of cell division correlate also with genomic demethylation involving methylation loss in late-replicating partial methylation domains. Here we find that immunomodulatory pathway genes are concentrated in these domains and transcriptionally repressed in demethylated tumours with CpG island promoter hypermethylation. Global methylation loss correlated with immune evasion signatures independently of mutation burden and aneuploidy. Methylome data of our cohort (n = 60) and a published cohort (n = 81) in lung cancer and a melanoma cohort (n = 40) consistently demonstrated that genomic methylation alterations counteract the contribution of high mutation burden and increase immunotherapeutic resistance. Higher predictive power was observed for methylation loss than mutation burden. We also found that genomic hypomethylation correlates with the immune escape signatures of aneuploid tumours. Hence, DNA methylation alterations implicate epigenetic modulation as a combination regimens for precision immunotherapy."

This project study the effect of a leading clinical drug that specifically targets the gene product of PIK3CA. Although this drug works well in HNSCC, it is anticipated that some patients will become resistant to it over time and will stop responding, as this has been observed when other 'targeted' drugs are used in other cancers. The goal here is to determine what molecular mechanisms are involved with mediating resistance over time to the PIK3CA drug. The drug is called ""BYL719"". A mouse xenograft model was created in this effect. Basically, a tumour from a patient with HNSCC was engrafted in multiple mice, and once it grew, the mice were treated with BYL719 or a vehicle (corn oil). Over time, the corn oil mice's tumours grow very quickly. The BYL719-treated mice's tumours are static for about the first 50 days of treatment (suggesting the drug is quite effective), but then begin to resume growth (suggesting they have become resistant to the drug). With the tumours collected from the mice at the end point of the study, we are using a multi-platform approach to figure out what the differences are in the BYL719-resistant tumours, compared to the corn oil tumours, primary tumour (never engrafted into mice) and the patient blood."

Then, the extent to which intra-tumor heterogeneity explains discrepancies in variants called between the FF and the FFPE samples was assessed by comparing the clonal and subclonal somatic variants. 
This study illustrates that when using the correct variant calling strategy, the majority of clonal SNVs can be recovered in an FFPE sample with high precision and sensitivity. These results suggest that somatic variants derived from WGS of FFPE material can be used in cohort studies."

EGAS00001005255,comparison  capture based method  transcriptome profiling  formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor samples,"Background: The need for fresh frozen (FF) tissue limits implementing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in the clinic. The majority of clinical samples are stored as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Exome capture platforms have been developed for RNA-seq from FFPE samples. However, these methods have not been systematically compared.
Methods: Transcriptomic analysis of 32 FFPE tumor samples from 11 patients was performed using three exome capture-based methods: Agilent SureSelect V6, TWIST NGS Exome, and IDT XGen Exome Research Panel. We compared these methods to TruSeq RNA-seq of fresh frozen (FF-TruSeq) tumor samples from the same patients. We assessed the recovery of clinically relevant biological features. 
Results: The Spearman's correlation coefficients between the global expression profiles of the three capture-based methods from FFPE and matched FF-TruSeq were high (rho = 0.72-0.9, p &lt; 0.05). A significant correlation between the expression of key immune genes between individual capture-based methods and FF-TruSeq (rho = 0.76-0.88, p &lt; 0.05) was observed. All exome capture-based methods reliably detected outlier expression of actionable genes, including ERBB2, MET, NTRK1, and PPARG. In urothelial cancer samples, the Agilent assay was associated with the highest molecular subtype concordance with FF-TruSeq (Cohen's k = 0.7, p &lt; 0.01). Both Agilent and IDT detected all the clinically relevant fusions that were initially identified in FF-TruSeq. 
Conclusion: All exome capture-based methods had comparable performance and concordance with FF-TruSeq. By enabling the interrogation of FFPE tumor samples, our findings will enable the implementation of RNA-seq in the clinic to guide precision oncology approaches."

This study examined ITH in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) by profiling four different sites of disease from a single patient that demonstrated a spatially discordant response to immuno-chemotherapy. The cell of origin differed across the sites of disease, with the chemosensitive inguinal tumor classified as germinal center type (GCB) and the chemorefractory disease above the diaphragm as either activated B cell type (ABC) or unclassified DLBCL. All biopsies shared mutations in CREBBP, KMT2D and CARD11 supporting their role as early driver events with the inguinal (EZH2, STAT6, GNA13, IRF8, PIK3CD) and mediastinal (TP53) sites evolving separately. The study case sheds light on the underlying genetic ITH in patients with a discordant response to treatment and suggests that a single biopsy may not capture the full genomic complexity present and spatial variations need to be considered in biomarker-led clinical studies."
EGAS00001003830,deep multi region  genome sequencing reveals heterogeneity  gene  environment interactions  treatment naive metastatic lung cancer,"Our understanding of genomic heterogeneity in lung cancer is largely based on the analysis of early-stage surgical specimens. Here we used endoscopic sampling of paired primary and intrathoracic metastatic tumors from 11 lung cancer patients to map genomic heterogeneity inoperable lung cancer with deep whole-genome sequencing. Intra-patient heterogeneity in driver or targetable mutations was predominantly in the form of copy number gain. Private mutation signatures, including patterns consistent with defects in homologous recombination, were highly variable both within and between patients. Irrespective of histotype, we observed a smaller than expected number of private mutations, suggesting that ancestral clones accumulated large mutation burdens immediately prior to metastasis. Single-region whole-genome sequencing of from 20 patients showed that tumors in ever-smokers with the strongest tobacco signatures were associated with germline variants in genes implicated in the repair of cigarette-induced DNA damage. Our results suggest that lung cancer precursors in ever-smokers accumulate large numbers of mutations prior to the formation of frank malignancy followed by rapid metastatic spread. In advanced lung cancer, germline variants in DNA repair genes may interact with the airway environment to influence the pattern of founder mutations, whereas similar interactions with the tumor microenvironment may play a role in the acquisition of mutations following metastasis."

Here we report de novo missense mutations in DNMT3A, encoding the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A, that cause microcephalic dwarfism, a hypocellular disorder of extreme global growth failure. Substitutions in the PWWP domain abrogate binding to the histone modifications H3K36me2/3, and alter DNA methylation in patient cells. Polycomb-associated DNA methylation canyons/valleys, hypomethylated domains encompassing developmental genes, become methylated with concomitant depletion of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 bivalent marks. Such de novo DNA methylation occurs during differentiation of Dnmt3aW326R pluripotent cells in vitro, and is also evident in Dnmt3aW326R/+ dwarf mice. We therefore propose that the interaction of the DNMT3A PWWP domain with H3K36me2/3 normally limits DNA methylation of polycomb-marked regions.  Our findings implicate the interplay between DNA methylation and polycomb at key developmental regulators as a determinant of organism size in mammals."

Overall survival remains poor despite advances of anti-MM therapy. In an attempt to identify key biological mechanisms that result in the aggressive pPCL phenotype we performed whole exome sequencing of 23 patients with pPCL. For matched non-tumor control for each patient to exclude germline variants we used CD34+ cells from stem cell harvest (n=20) or cells obtained from buccal swabs (n=3). Tumor samples were from bone marrow derived CD138+ cells. Tumor samples were compared to the germline control to identify somatic abnormalities.
EGAS00001004555,clinical outcomes  tumor mutational burden  inflammatory gene expression  combined nivolumab  ipilimumab  monotherapy  advanced melanoma cm67 wes,"Purpose
Exploratory analyses of CheckMate 066 and 067 trials were conducted to investigate associations of tumor mutational burden (TMB), a 4-gene inflammatory gene expression signature, and BRAF mutation status with tumor response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced melanoma.
Patients and Methods
Patients with known programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and BRAF mutation status received nivolumab (NIVO) or dacarbazine in CheckMate 066 and either NIVO, ipilimumab (IPI), or NIVO+IPI in CheckMate 067. Whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing were used to determine TMB and inflammatory gene expression signature scores, respectively. These biomarkers were evaluated in terms of their association with PFS and OS.
Results
In the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI arms of CheckMate 067, longer survival was associated with high (&amp;amp;gt; median) versus low (≤ median) TMB with hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence interval [CI]) for PFS of 0.45 (0.30–0.65), 0.55 (0.38–0.81), and 0.60 (0.43–0.82), and for OS of 0.46 (0.30–0.71), 0.53 (0.34–0.82), and 0.52 (0.36–0.74), respectively. For NIVO-treated patients, these results were confirmed in CheckMate 066. A survival benefit was observed with high TMB and absence of BRAF mutation. Survival was associated with high versus low inflammatory signature scores with HRs (95% CI) for PFS of 0.56 (0.34–0.94), 0.40 (0.23–0.72), and 0.43 (0.27–0.70), and for OS of 0.37 (0.20–0.66), 0.38 (0.19–0.74), and 0.46 (0.27–0.79), in the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI arms, respectively. Weak correlations were observed between PD-L1, TMB, and the inflammatory signature.
Conclusions
Combined assessment of TMB, inflammatory gene expression signature, and BRAF mutation status may be predictive for response to immunotherapy in advanced melanoma."
EGAS00001004355,cell free dna fragmentation patterns  personalized sequencing reveal circulating tumor dna  urine  plasma  glioma patients,"Glioma-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is challenging to detect using liquid biopsy as levels in body fluids are low.
We determined the glioma-derived DNA fractions in tumor biopsies, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), plasma and urine samples, using deep sequencing of personalized capture panels. By sequencing cfDNA across thousands of mutations identified individually in each patient’s matched tumor we detected tumor-derived DNA in plasma (10/12) and urine samples (8/11). The median tumor fraction was 6.4x10-3 in CSF, 3.1x10-5 in plasma and 4.7x10-5 in urine. We identified a shift in the size distribution for mutant cfDNA fragments in these body fluids.
Next, we analyzed cfDNA fragment sizes with paired-end shallow whole genome sequencing (WGS) in urine samples from 35 patients with gliomas, 8 individuals with non-malignant brain disorders, and 26 controls (n=69 individuals, 96 samples). cfDNA in urine of glioma patients was significantly more fragmented compared to urine from patients with non-malignant brain disorders (t-test, p=1.7x10-2) and compared to urine of controls (t-test, p=5.2x10-9). The proportion of DNA fragments &lt;60 bp was higher in glioma patients urine and could be used for classification (AUC=0.93). Machine learning models integrating fragment lengths could identify urine samples from glioma patients (AUC=0.97 in cross-validation)."

After excluding cases representing other established entities or subgroups, we identified 120 cases to be part of an intrinsic spectrum of disease in the infant population. These included those with targetable MAP-kinase alterations, and a large proportion of remaining cases to harbour gene fusions targeting ALK, NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 and MET as their driving alterations, with evidence of efficacy of targeted agents in the clinic.

The majority of T-ALL cases harbor activating mutations in NOTCH1 together with mutations in genes implicated in kinase signaling, transcriptional regulation or protein translation. To obtain more insight in the level of clonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and during treatment, we used single-cell targeted DNA sequencing with the Tapestri platform. We designed a custom ALL panel and obtained accurate single-nucleotide variant and small insertion-deletion mutation calling for 305 amplicons covering 110 genes in about 4400 cells per sample and time point. A total of 108,188 cells were analyzed for 25 samples of 8 T-ALL patients. We typically observed a major clone at diagnosis (&gt;35% of the cells) accompanied by several minor clones of which some were less than 1% of the total number of cells. Four patients had &gt;2 NOTCH1 mutations some of which present in minor clones, indicating a strong pressure to acquire NOTCH1 mutations in developing T-ALL cells. By analyzing longitudinal samples, we detected the presence and clonal nature of residual leukemic cells as well as clones with a minor presence at diagnosis that evolved to clinically relevant major clones at later disease stages. Single-cell DNA amplicon sequencing is a sensitive assay to detect clonal architecture and evolution in T-ALL."

Hallmarks of disease severity revealed cells, their inflammatory mediators and networks as potential therapeutic targets, including progenitor cells and specific myeloid and lymphocyte subsets, features of the immune repertoire, acute phase response, metabolism and coagulation. Persisting immune activation involving AP-1/p38MAPK was a specific feature of COVID-19. The plasma proteome enabled sub-phenotyping into patient clusters, predictive of severity and outcome.

EGAS00001005305,bulk tissue rna sequencing  anterior cingulate cortex samples derived  lewy body disease patients,"Parkinson’s disease (PD), Parkinson’s disease with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are three clinically, genetically and neuropathologically overlapping neurodegenerative diseases collectively known as the Lewy body diseases (LBDs). A variety of molecular mechanisms have been implicated in PD pathogenesis, but the mechanisms underlying PDD and DLB remain largely unknown, a knowledge gap that presents an impediment to the discovery of disease-modifying therapies. Transcriptomic profiling can contribute to addressing this gap, but remains limited in the LBDs. Here, we applied paired bulk-tissue and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to anterior cingulate cortex samples derived from 28 individuals, including healthy controls, PD, PDD and DLB cases (n = 7 per group), to transcriptomically profile the LBDs. Using this approach, we (i) found transcriptional alterations in multiple cell types across the LBDs; (ii) discovered evidence for widespread dysregulation of RNA splicing, particularly in PDD and DLB; (iii) identified potential splicing factors, with links to other dementia-related neurodegenerative diseases, coordinating this dysregulation; and (iv) identified transcriptomic commonalities and distinctions between the LBDs that inform understanding of the relationships between these three clinical disorders. Together, these findings have important implications for the design of RNA-targeted therapies for these diseases and highlight a potential molecular “window” of therapeutic opportunity between the initial onset of PD and subsequent development of Lewy body dementia."
EGAS00001003432, genome sequencing  linked reads  pediatric glioblastoma samples,"Pediatric glioblastoma (pGBM) is a lethal cancer with no effective therapies. To understand mechanisms of tumor evolution in this cancer, we performed whole genome sequencing with linked reads on longitudinally resected pGBM samples. Our analyses showed that all diagnostic and recurrent samples were collections of genetically diverse subclones. Clonal composition rapidly evolved at recurrence, with less than 8% of non-synonymous single nucleotide variants being shared in diagnostic-recurrent pairs. In order to track the origins of the mutational events we observed in pGBM, we generated whole genome datasets for two patients and their parents. These trios showed that genetic variants could be (i) somatic, (ii) inherited from a healthy parent, or (iii) arose de novo in the germlines of pGBM patients. Analysis of variant allele frequencies supported a model of tumor growth involving slow-cycling cancer stem cells that give rise to fast-proliferating progenitor-like cells and to non-dividing cells. Interestingly, radiation and anti-mitotic chemotherapeutics did not increase overall tumor burden upon recurrence. These findings support an important role for slow-cycling stem cell populations in contributing to recurrences, since slow-cycling cell populations are expected to be less prone to genotoxic stress induced by these treatments and to accumulate few mutations. Our results highlight the need for new targeted treatments that account for the complex functional hierarchies and genomic heterogeneity of pGBM."

The initiative is led by investigators based at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and funding support from the Wellcome and NIH. We aim to interrogate the cellular composition and molecular regulators underpinning a cells identity through; genetic and genomic analysis, expression analysis, non-identifiable video imaging and cell line and organoid production, as well as, computational algorithms to predict cellular developmental trajectories and cell-cell interactions. We will subsequently validate these findings in situ using spatial genomic and imaging technologies e.g. immunohistochemistry, RNAscope, in situ sequencing and spatial transcriptomic analyses.

Cell atlas of Adult immune system - The Human Cell Atlas initiative is an ambitious global research effort which aims to describe every cell in the human body across all developmental stages to generate a reference map to accelerate progress in science and medicine particularly relating to human development and disease. The initiative is led by investigators based at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and funding support from the Wellcome and NIH. We aim to interrogate the cellular composition and molecular regulators underpinning a cells identity through; genetic and genomic analysis, expression analysis, non-identifiable video imaging and cell line and organoid production, as well as, computational algorithms to predict cellular developmental trajectories and cell-cell interactions. We will subsequently validate these findings in situ using spatial genomic and imaging technologies e.g. immunohistochemistry, RNAscope, in situ sequencing and spatial transcriptomic analyses.

Genetic analysis of 85 unrelated “mutation negative” probands with Martsolf or Martsolf-like syndromes identified two individuals with different homozygous null mutations in ITPA, the gene encoding inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPase).  Both probands were from multiplex families with a consistent, lethal and highly distinctive disorder; a Martsolf-like syndrome with infantile-onset dilated cardiomyopathy. Severe ITPase-deficiency has been previously reported with infantile epileptic encephalopathy (MIM 616647).  ITPase acts to prevent incorporation of inosine bases (rI/dI) into RNA and DNA. In Itpa-null cells dI was undetectable in genomic DNA.  dI could be identified at a low level in mtDNA without detectable mitochondrial genome instability, mtDNA depletion or biochemical dysfunction of the mitochondria. rI accumulation was detectable in proband-derived lymphoblastoid RNA. In Itpa-null mouse embryos rI was detectable in the brain and kidney with the highest level seen in the embryonic heart (rI at 1 in 385 bases). Transcriptome and proteome analysis in mutant cells revealed no major differences with controls. The rate of transcription and the total amount of cellular RNA also appeared normal. rI accumulation in RNA – and by implication rI production - correlates with the severity of organ dysfunction in ITPase deficiency but the basis of the cellulopathy remains cryptic.

EGAS00001004309,thymic organoid,"Single cell RNA sequencing of cells from thymic organoids, which include differentiating human iPSCs and mouse stromal cells.

There are many different T cell subsets which carry out different immune functions. Examples include cytotoxic CD8+ T cells that protect us against infection and cancer, and suppressive T regulatory cells (Tregs) that keep immune reactions under control. The power of T cells has been harnessed and widely applied in various fields of clinical medicine. Current examples include chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in cancer immunotherapy [1, 2]. At the same time, Tregs with their special suppressive function, have been used in autoimmune diseases and solid organ transplantation [3, 4] to try to establish tolerance. 

The thymus is a unique organ where T cells mature and develop into different lineages. Our lab has recently elucidated a comprehensive transcriptional network of T cell development by performing single-cell RNA-seq in human thymus across different developmental stages i.e. embryo, fetus, child, and adult (manuscript under revision at Science). We now have a good understanding of which transcription factors are involved in development of different T cell lineages in vivo.

A recent paper from Montel-Hagen et al. [5] has built the most efficient in vitro system to date in order to generate mature T cells from stem cells including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) utilising an artificial thymic organoid system (ATO). The main output from this current ATO system is CD8 single positive T cells, with very few CD4 T cells and even fewer Tregs. We aim to induce expression of the key transcription factors identified from our human thymus sequencing study, to engineer T cell development towards Tregs in this in vitro system. Our end goal is to generate ‘off-the-shelf’ suppressive Tregs.

Thymus is a primary lymphoid organ that creates an environment for the T lymphocyte precursors differentiation into the naive T cells, which involves TCR gene rearrangement, negative and positive selection. Despite thymus critical function for the recognition of the pathogens it starts to atrophy very early in life. Thymic Epithelial Space (TES), where thymocyte education occurs, starts to decline rapidly just after birth, while with the onset of puberty thymus  is also progressively replaced with adipose tissue. This leads to a reduced naive T cell output,which decreases an organism's ability to recognize pathogens.
In our lab, we have already collected and characterized cell type composition and gene regulatory networks of the fetal tand adult human thymus (Park et al, Science 2020). In the current project we plan to expand the number of paediatric and adult samples in the study with the aim to understand how the process of thymic involution happens. We will use single-cell transcriptomics to zoom on changes that occur in immune and non-immune cell types in different phases of thymic involution with the hope to understand which gene expression changes are causal for the thymic involution process and how naïve T cell production can be increased in elderly.

Using a Wright-Fisher population genetics model, we inferred reproducible CNA-defined clonal fitness dynamics induced by TP53 mutation and cisplatin chemotherapy, with accurate forecasting of experimentally enforced clonal competition dynamics. Drug treatment in three long-term serially passaged TNBC PDX resulted in cisplatin resistant clones that had shown low fitness in the untreated setting. By contrast high fitness clones from treatment naive controls were eradicated reflecting an inversion of the fitness landscape.  Upon drug release selective pressure dynamics were reversed indicating a fitness cost of treatment resistance.

Using co-immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry and ChIP sequencing we show that HDAC2 is a cofactor of MYC in MYC amplified medulloblastoma. The MYC-HDAC2 complex is bound to genes defining the MYC-dependent transcriptional profile. Class I HDAC inhibition leads to stabilization and reduced DNA binding of MYC protein inducing a down-regulation of MYC activated genes (MAGs) and up-regulation of MYC repressed genes (MRGs). MAGs and MRGs are characterized by opposing biological functions and by distinct E-box distribution.

Multi-level and microdissected sampling strikingly reveal that many clones with different DNMT3A mutations exist in these benign tumors, suggesting that intra-tumor heterogeneity is common. Integrated genomic, methylation and transcriptomic profiling in selected tumours suggest that isoform specific DNMT3A2 mutations are associated with dysregulated Wnt/ß-catenin pathway signaling.

We recently described a gene expression signature that identifies 27% of germinal center B-cell DLBCLs (GCB-DLBCLs) as having a double-hit-like expression pattern (DHITsig) and inferior outcomes; however, only half of these cases have both MYC and BCL2 translocations identifiable using standard breakapart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Here, 20 DHITsig+ GCB-DLBCLs apparently lacking MYC and/or BCL2 rearrangements underwent whole-genome sequencing. This revealed 6 tumors with MYC or BCL2 rearrangements that were cryptic to breakapart FISH. Copy-number analysis identified 3 tumors with MYC and 6 tumors with MIR17HG gains or amplifications, both of which may contribute to dysregulation of MYC and its downstream pathways. Focal deletions of the PVT1 promoter were observed exclusively among DHITsig+ tumors lacking MYC translocations; this may also contribute to MYC overexpression. These results highlight that FISH fails to identify all HGBL-DH/THs, while revealing a range of other genetic mechanisms potentially underlying MYC dysregulation in DHITsig+ DLBCL, suggesting that gene expression profiling is more sensitive for identifying the biology underlying poor outcomes in GCB-DLBCL."

EGAS00001003567,rna sequencing  chd1l knock  jurkat clones,"In a recent meta-analysis of GWAS conducted in Africa, we and collaborators identified a novel population specific signal associated with HIV viral load (VL) among untreated HIV infected individuals. This variant is absent in Europeans, and has a frequency varying between 3.6% and 12.6% among Africans. The variant is located within a long intergenic noncoding RNA (LINC00624), which lies between the protein coding genes CHD1L and BLC9 and appears to be in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a splice site 1bp insertion at the start of exon 6 of the CHD1L gene. In a first round of experiments we generated CRISPR homozygous and heterozygotes frame shift knockouts (KO) of CHD1L from KOS iPSC lines. Viral infection experiments on these clones, after differentiation into macrophages, support a role for CHD1L in viral replication with higher viral activity observed in homozygotes KO. For the next set of experiments, we have generated CRISPR homozygous and heterozygotes CHD1L KO from an immortalized line of T lymphocytes (Jurkat, Clone E6-1). Total RNA sequencing as well as Western blots will be carried out in Jurkat clones to confirm the lack of gene product in knockout clones in comparison with wild type clones.

EGAS00001003147,dna methylomes  monozygotic twins clinically discordant  multiple sclerosis,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Although genetic susceptibility is important, a modest concordance rate for MS in monozygotic (MZ) twins suggests that interaction with other risk factors is required to develop clinical symptoms. In this study, we examined whether DNA methylation differences contribute to the discordant clinical manifestation of MS in MZ twins, and studied the impact of MS treatments on the DNA methylome. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 45 MZ twins clinically discordant for MS were generated using the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array. Repetitive element methylation and selected differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were validated using targeted deep bisulfite sequencing (TDBS). In addition, we performed whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to profile CD4+ memory T-cells of a subset of four MS discordant MZ twins. Our results show that interferon treatment causes robust DNA methylation changes and several epigenetic biomarkers for interferon treatment response were identified. However, overall the PBMC-based methylomes of the MS discordant MZ twins were highly similar, since large systematic methylation differences (&gt;5%) were absent in the data. This suggests that previously reported large methylation changes are probably caused by genetic rather than epigenetic differences. In addition, our data does not support the hypothesis that the observed maternal parent-of-origin effect in MS is due to genomic imprinting errors, and no evidence was found that copy number variations explain the discordant phenotype in these MZ twins. Although not genome-wide significant, a couple of DMPs associated with the MS phenotype were identified and successfully technically replicated using TDBS, including a differentially methylated region (DMR) in the promoter of the transmembrane protein encoding gene TMEM232. Another MS-associated DMP, located in an enhancer in the gene body of the transcription factor ZBTB16, was also associated with medium-term glucocorticoid treatment history. WGBS analysis confirmed this DMP as a promising epigenetic biomarker for glucocorticoid treatment. In conclusion, this epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) in genetically identical twins identified a DMR in the TMEM232 promoter as a candidate loci associated with the clinical manifestation of MS. In addition, epigenetic biomarkers for MS treatments were identified, revealing that not only short-term, but also medium-term treatment effects are detectable in immune cells, which should be taken into account in future EWAS designs."

Integration of DNA contact maps with chromatin and transcriptional profiles identified specific mechanisms of gene regulation, including individual physical interactions between regulatory regions and their target genes. Residing in structurally conserved regions in GSCs was CD276, a gene known to play a role in immuno-modulation. We show that, unexpectedly, CD276 is part of a stemness network in GSCs and can be targeted with an antibody-drug conjugate to curb self-renewal, a key stemness property. Our results demonstrate that integrated structural genomics datasets can be employed to rationally identify therapeutic vulnerabilities in self-renewing cells."

Population structure analysis demonstrated great representation of Asian genetic diversity by three ethnicities in Singapore, and revealed a Malay-related novel ancestry component. Furthermore, demographic inference suggested that Malays split from Chinese ~24,800 years ago, and experienced significant admixture with East Asians ~1,700 years ago, coinciding with the Austronesian expansion. Additionally, we identified 20 candidate loci for natural selection, among which 14 harbored robust associations with complex traits and diseases.

Exploratory analyses of CheckMate 066 and 067 trials were conducted to investigate associations of tumor mutational burden (TMB), a 4-gene inflammatory gene expression signature, and BRAF mutation status with tumor response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced melanoma.
Patients and Methods
Patients with known programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and BRAF mutation status received nivolumab (NIVO) or dacarbazine in CheckMate 066 and either NIVO, ipilimumab (IPI), or NIVO+IPI in CheckMate 067. Whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing were used to determine TMB and inflammatory gene expression signature scores, respectively. These biomarkers were evaluated in terms of their association with PFS and OS.
Results
In the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI arms of CheckMate 067, longer survival was associated with high (&gt; median) versus low (≤ median) TMB with hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence interval [CI]) for PFS of 0.45 (0.30–0.65), 0.55 (0.38–0.81), and 0.60 (0.43–0.82), and for OS of 0.46 (0.30–0.71), 0.53 (0.34–0.82), and 0.52 (0.36–0.74), respectively. For NIVO-treated patients, these results were confirmed in CheckMate 066. A survival benefit was observed with high TMB and absence of BRAF mutation. Survival was associated with high versus low inflammatory signature scores with HRs (95% CI) for PFS of 0.56 (0.34–0.94), 0.40 (0.23–0.72), and 0.43 (0.27–0.70), and for OS of 0.37 (0.20–0.66), 0.38 (0.19–0.74), and 0.46 (0.27–0.79), in the NIVO, NIVO+IPI, and IPI arms, respectively.

Most oligodendrogliomas have chromosome 1p/19q co-deletion and IDH mutation. We analyzed 51 AOs by whole-exome sequencing, identifying previously reported frequent somatic mutations in CIC and FUBP1. We also identified recurrent mutations in TCF12 and in an additional series of 83 AO. Overall 7.5% of AO are mutated for TCF12, which encodes an oligodendrocyte-related transcription factor. 80% of TCF12 mutations identified were in either the bHLH domain, which is important for TCF12 function as a transcription factor, or were frame shift mutations leading to TCF12 truncated for this domain. We show that these mutations compromise TCF12 transcriptional activity and are associated with a more aggressive tumor type. Our analysis provides further insights into the unique and shared pathways driving AO."

We recently identified subclonal loss-of-function mutations in the H4 lysine methyltransferase KMT5B to be associated with enhanced invasion/migration, but the mechanism by which this occurred was unclear. Here we use integrated ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and RNA-seq on patient-derived, subclonal and CRISPR-Cas9-KD DIPG cells to show that loss of KMT5B/C causes depletion of these retained H3K27me3 loci via changes in chromatin accessibility, causing a raft of transcriptional changes which promote tumorigenesis. De-repression occurred at bivalent loci marked by H3K4me3, driving increased transcriptional heterogeneity and elevated gene expression associated with increased invasion, abrogated DNA repair and mesenchymal transition, along with a markedly altered secretome. These data suggest a previously unrecognised trans-histone (H4/H3) interaction in DIPG cells with a potentially profound effect on their diffusely infiltrating phenotype.This datasets comprises ChIP sequencing of H4K20me3, H3K27me3, H3K4me3, H3K9me3 and H4K16ac marks in both naturally occurring and CRISPR engineered KMT5B/C mutant cultured cells from DIPGs."

In turn, active enhancers and promoters are not created de novo and instead reflect the epigenomic landscape of the cell of origin. H3K27ac is enriched at repeat elements, resulting in their increased expression, which in turn can be further amplified by DNA demethylation and histone deacetylase inhibitors providing an exquisite therapeutic vulnerability.

To assist the investigation of DIGs, advanced culture conditions are needed to establish personalized preclinical tools using patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs).Methods: We constructed a cellular growth rate screening platform called ‘GFSCAN’, which contains 132 different oncogenic growth factor combinations in serum-free neurobasal media. Seventy-two patient-derived GSCs were examined by GFSCAN, and their genomic profiles were also obtained. GFSCAN resulted in cell growth index to represent the cellular growth rate for each culture condition for each GSC.Results: Cell growth indexes generated by GFSCAN revealed that GSCs were clustered according to EGF and basic FGF (E&amp;F) dependency. IDH1-wild-type GSCs showed higher E&amp;F dependencies than IDH1-mutant GSCs, but mesenchymal IDH1-wild-type GSCs were relatively less dependent on E&amp;F. Therefore, we determined the improved in vitro cultivation conditions of E&amp;F independent GSCs based on their genomic and molecular characteristics, including IDH1 mutation, 1p/19q codeletion, ATRX alterations, and transcriptional subtype.Conclusions: We have identified the most optimal culture condition according to the genetic characteristics of GSCs through novel GFSCAN approach."

Gametes halve their genome in preparation for fertilisation during a specialized cell division known as meiosis. The process by which meiosis is co-ordinated with gamete formation in females is poorly understood, principally because it commences in utero and is not completed until decades later when the mature egg is ovulated and fertilised. 
To address the many gaps in our knowledge of the development of the germline and reproductive system in humans, we propose to generate a comprehensive cell atlas of adult gonads. We will combine gene-expression profiling at the single-cell level and atac-seq with new methods of gene-expression detection directly on the tissue to study the cellular environment at an unprecedented resolution and coverage. Information about the expression of the myriad of cells and cell states in reproductive cells will greatly advance our understanding of the development of the female reproductive system and the emergence and maintenance of the female germline in humans.

Worldwide, tobacco smoking is the major lifestyle exposure that causes cancer, exerting carcinogenicity through 60 chemicals that bind and mutate DNA. Using massively parallel sequencing technology, we sequenced a small cell lung cancer cell line, NCI-H209, to explore the mutational burden associated with tobacco smoking. 22,910 somatic substitutions were identified, including 132 in coding exons. Multiple mutation signatures testify to the cocktail of carcinogens in tobacco smoke and their proclivities for particular bases and surrounding sequence context. Effects of transcription-coupled repair and a second, more general expression-linked repair pathway were evident. We identified a tandem duplication that duplicates exons 3-8 of CHD7 in-frame, and another two lines carrying PVT1-CHD7 fusion genes, suggesting that CHD7 may be recurrently rearranged in this disease. These findings illustrate the potential for next-generation sequencing to provide unprecedented insights into mutational processes, cellular repair pathways and gene networks associated with cancer.

Comprehensive genomic analysis has revealed a list of molecular aberrations that are essential to tumorigenesis, progression, and metastasis of gynecologic tumors. However, targeting such alterations has frequently led to treatment failures due to underlying genomic complexity and activation of various tumor cell survival pathway molecules. A compilation of molecular characterization of tumors with pharmacological drug response is the next step towards clinical application of patient-tailored treatment regimens. Toward this goal, we have established a library of 139 gynecologic tumors including cervical, endometrial, and epithelial ovarian cancers (EOCs) and uterine sarcomas that were genomically and/or pharmacologically annotated and explored dynamic pharmacogenomic associations against 37 molecularly targeted drugs. We discovered lineage-specific drug sensitivities based on subcategorization of gynecologic tumors and identified TP53 mutation as a molecular determinant that elicit therapeutic response to poly (ADP-Ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. We further identified transcriptome expression of inhibitor of DNA biding 2 (ID2) as a potential predictive biomarker for treatment response to olaparib. Together, our results demonstrate potential utility of rapid drug screening combined with genomic profiling for precision treatment of gynecologic cancers."

Understanding the genetic basis of hepatocellular carcinoma at surgically curable stages may enable the identification of new molecular biomarkers that accurately identify patients in need of additional early therapeutic interventions. Whole exome sequencing and copy number analysis was performed on 231 hepatocellular carcinomas (72% with hepatitis B viral infection) that were classified as early-stage hepatocellular carcinomas, candidates for surgical resection. Recurrent mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing. Unsupervised genomic analyses identified an association between specific genetic aberrations and postoperative clinical outcomes. Recurrent somatic mutations were identified in 9 genes, including TP53, CTNNB1, AXIN1, RPS6KA3, and RB1. Recurrent homozygous deletions in FAM123A, RB1, and CDKN2A, and high-copy amplifications in MYC, RSPO2, CCND1, and FGF19 were detected. Pathway analyses of these genes revealed aberrations in the p53, Wnt, PIK3/Ras, cell cycle, and chromatin remodelling pathways. RB1 mutations were significantly associated with cancer-specific and recurrence-free survival after resection (p = 0.016 and p = 0.001, respectively). FGF19 amplifications, known to activate Wnt signalling, were mutually exclusive with CTNNB1 and AXIN1 mutations, and significantly associated with cirrhosis (p = 0.017).  RB1 mutations can be used as a prognostic molecular biomarker for resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Further study is required to investigate the potential role of FGF19 amplification in driving hepatocarcinogenesis in patients with liver cirrhosis and to investigate the potential of anti-FGF19 treatment in these patients."

We established paired cancer (n=32) and normal organoids (n=18) from 20 patients enriched in microsatellite-stable EOCRC. Exome and transcriptome analysis was performed. We observed a striking diversity of molecular phenotypes, including PTPRK-RSPO3 fusions. Transcriptionally, RSPO fusion organoids resembled normal colon organoids and were distinct from APC mutant organoids, with high BMP2 and low PTK7 expression. Single cell transcriptome analysis confirmed the similarity between RSPO fusion organoids and normal organoids, with a propensity for maturation on Wnt withdrawal, whereas the APC mutant organoids were locked in progenitor stages. CRISPR/Cas9 engineered mutation of APC in normal human colon organoids led to upregulation of PTK7 protein and suppression of BMP2, but less so with an engineered RNF43 mutation. The frequent co-occurrence of RSPO fusions with SMAD4 or BMPR1A mutation was confirmed in TCGA database searches. RNF43 mutation was found in organoid from a leukaemia survivor with a novel mutational signature; and organoids with POLE proofreading mutation displayed ultramutation. The cancer organoid genomes were stable over long culture periods, while normal human colon organoids tended to be subject to clonal dominance over time. These organoid models enriched in EOCRCs with linked genomic data fill a gap in existing CRC models and reveal distinct genetic profiles and novel pathway cooperativity."

The gut microbial community is complex, dynamic, and exhibits considerable intra- and interpersonal variation in its composition and functions. The massive number of potential interactions between its components makes it challenging to define the mechanisms by which food ingredients affect community properties. There is also a paucity of information about the ‘bioactive’ ingredients of foods that influence the fitness and expressed functions of community members. Here, plant fibres, from different sustainable sources and targeting distinct features of obese human gut microbiomes in gnotobiotic mice, were formulated into snack prototypes and used to supplement controlled diets consumed by overweight and obese adults; the results revealed fibre-specific changes in their microbiomes that were linked to changes in their plasma proteomes indicative of altered physiologic state."

We investigated the utility of massively parallel sequencing to characterize an adenocarcinoma of the tongue, before and after treatment. 
                        Results - In the pre-treatment tumor we identified 7,629 genes within regions of copy number gain. 1,078 genes exhibited increased expression relative to the blood and unrelated tumors and four genes contained somatic protein-coding mutations. Our analysis suggested the tumor cells were driven by the RET oncogene. Genes whose protein products are targeted by the RET inhibitors sunitinib and sorafenib correlated with being amplified and or highly expressed. Consistent with our observations administration of sunitinib was associated with stable disease lasting 4 months, after which the lung lesions began to grow.  Administration of sorafenib and sulindac provided disease stabilization for an additional 3 months after which the cancer progressed and new lesions appeared. A recurring metastasis possessed 7,288 genes within copy number amplicons, 385 genes exhibiting increased expression relative to other tumours and 9 new somatic protein coding mutations. The observed mutations and amplif
                        ications were  consistent with therapeutic resistance arising through activation of the MAPK and AKT pathways. Conclusions - We conclude that complete genomic characterization of a rare tumour has the potential to aid in clinical decision making and identifying therapeutic approaches where no established treatment protocols exist.  These results also provide direct in-vivo genomic evidence for mutational evolution within a tumor under drug selection and potential mechanisms of drug resistance accrual.

Previous studies indicate that this disease has a complex genomic landscape, with frequent copy number changes and point mutations, but genomic rearrangements have not been characterized in detail. Despite the clinical importance of metastasis, there remain fundamental questions about the clonal structures of metastatic tumours, including phylogenetic relationships among metastases, the scale of ongoing parallel evolution in metastatic and primary sites, and how the tumour disseminates. Here we harness advances in DNA sequencing to annotate genomic rearrangements in 13 patients with pancreatic cancer and explore clonal relationships among metastases. We find that pancreatic cancer acquires rearrangements indicative of telomere dysfunction and abnormal cell-cycle control, namely dysregulated G1-to-S-phase transition with intact G2â€“M checkpoint. These initiate amplification of cancer genes and occur predominantly in early cancer development rather than the later stages of the disease. Genomic instability frequently persists after cancer dissemination, resulting in ongoing, parallel and even convergent evolution among different metastases. We find evidence that there is genetic heterogeneity among metastasis-initiating cells, that seeding metastasis may require driver mutations beyond those required for primary tumours, and that phylogenetic trees across metastases show organ-specific branches. These data attest to the richness of genetic variation in cancer, brought about by the tandem forces of genomic instability and evolutionary selection."

Using RNA- and small RNA-sequencing in parallel, we explored differentially expressed genes in the hippocampus and cortex of MTLE patients who had undergone surgical resection and non-epileptic controls. We found significant enrichment for astrocytic and microglial genes amongst up-regulated genes and down-regulation of neuron-specific genes in the hippocampus of MTLE patients. The transcriptome profile of the small RNAs reflected disease state more robustly than mRNAs, even across brain regions which show very little pathology."

Currently there are no effective treatments for mesothelioma and majority of patients will die within a year after diagnosis. Although a large number of preclinical and clinical trials assessed the efficacy of various therapuetic modes, none of the tested molecules entered the clinic. Thus, to better understand what drives mesothelioma carcinogenesis and to identify novel targets for therapy, here we aim at performing WGS of heathy mesothelial cells and a panel of mesothelioma cells lines. Primary mesothelial cell lines were established in prof. Marciniak lab from human pleural specimens, while primary mesothelioma cell lines were obtained from MesobanK. Both models constitute low passage cell lines and therefore should closely represent genetics of the original tissue."
EGAS00001004383,matching  actionable mutations  therapies  cancer patients comparison  three commercial decision support platforms,"Purpose: In oncology, precision medicine centers on tailoring the most appropriate therapy to a patient according to their tumor molecular profile. We addressed the question whether there is a consensus in the classification of actionability of somatic variants and their alignment to treatment recommendations. To this end, we evaluated three commercial clinical decision support tools to assess their variant classification and drug matching strategies.Methods: In this two centers study 48 patients with metastatic breast (n=12), colorectal (n=17) or non-small cell lung cancer (n=19) were recruited based on circulating tumor DNA levels in peripheral blood. In individual patients’ plasma samples, we established somatic copy number alterations and somatic mutations across a 77 cancer-associated gene panel and exposed the obtained molecular profiles to the decision support packages NAVIFY Mutation Profiler (NMP; Roche), Qiagen Clinical Insight (QCI) Interpret (Qiagen) and CureMatch Bionov (CureMatch).Results: In the plasma samples, altogether 492 somatic alterations were assessed. Each decision support platform varied in their format of data input, mode of variant classification and strategies for identifying druggable targets and clinical trials, which resulted in discrepancies in tier classification as well as designations of actionability. The frequency of concordant actionable events for tier I-A or tier I-B classifications, i.e. those with the strongest clinical evidence, was only 4.3%, 9.5% and 28.4% when comparing NMP with QCI, NMP with CureMatch, and CureMatch with QCI, respectively. As a consequence, the obtained treatment recommendations differed drastically, and alignment of treatment recommendations was limited to established predictive markers.Conclusions: The lack of standards for the extraction of treatment recommendations from comprehensive tumor molecular profiling data challenge the promising concepts of precision oncology."
EGAS00001004384,profiling  circulating tumor dna  treatment selection  patients  advanced  refractory carcinoma  prospective  stage phase ii individualized cancer treatment trial,"PURPOSETo evaluate the success of a targeted therapy selected by molecular profiling (MP) of circulating tumor DNA in patients with advanced and refractory carcinoma in a prospective setting.PATIENTS AND METHODSIn this single-center trial, patients with advanced and refractory carcinoma were enrolled and a mandatory blood draw as well as an optional tissue biopsy were obtained for molecular profiling. Whole-genome sequencing and a cancer hotspot panel were performed on plasma DNA and tissue DNA (hotspot panel only) and publicly available databases were used to match the molecular profile to targeted treatments based on the annotated results, which were discussed at a molecular tumor board. The primary endpoint was the progression-free survival (PFS) ratio (PFS on MP-guided therapy / PFS on the last evidence-based therapy), whereas the success of the targeted therapy was defined as a PFS ratio ≥ 1.2. Secondary endpoints were the number of patients for whom an anti-tumor drug could be defined based on the molecular profile, the overall survival (OS) and the overall radiographic response rate (ORR).  In order to test the impact of molecular profile-treatment matching strategies, we retrospectively analyzed selected cases via the CureMatch PreciGENE™ decision support algorithm.RESULTSAfter inclusion of 24 patients, an interim analysis was performed. Overall, MP yielded informative results from 20 patients (83%), meaning that tumor-specific DNA content in plasma was above 5% and that either a somatic mutation or copy number alteration could be detected from plasma or tissue. A potential tumor-specific drug could be matched in 11 out of 24 patients (46%). Eight patients (33%) received a matched treatment. Median PFS in the matched treatment group was 61 days (IQR 49.8-71) compared to 78 days (IQR 61.5-144) of the last evidence-based treatment, resulting in a median PFS ratio of 0.7 (IQR 0.6-0.9). Hence, as no patient experienced a PFS ratio ≥ 1.2, the study was terminated. Whereas database-based molecular profiling matching suggested mainly single drugs, the retrospective CureMatch analysis identified either a 2-drug or 3-drug combination option in each of the tested cases, including a case for which no therapy was previously identified.CONCLUSIONOur study is the first to report prospective outcome results on the efficacy of plasma DNA profiling-based treatment, but it challenges the routine use of this procedure for treatment selection in advanced cancer patients outside of clinical trials. More innovative approaches to study design, matching algorithms and drug allocation strategies are necessary to achieve improved patient outcomes."
EGAS00001003895, genome   transcriptome sequencing  patients diagnosed  angiosarcoma,"Angiosarcomas are rare, clinically-aggressive tumors with a predilection for the elderly and immunosuppressed, which has incited suspicion of an oncogenic virus. We studied the metagenomic landscape of angiosarcomas and identified reads mapping to human herpesvirus-7 (HHV-7). Overall, HHV-7 was present in two-thirds of angiosarcomas, particularly in cases with low tumor mutation burden and lacking signatures of ultraviolet-induced DNA damage. Transcriptomic profiling revealed the enrichment of tumor inflammation signatures in HHV7-positive angiosarcomas. In conclusion, we identified a distinct “inflammatory” subtype of angiosarcoma associated with HHV-7."
EGAS00001003923,wes  2 human osteosarcoma  corresponding cell lines,"Progress in the systemic control of osteosarcoma has been limited over the past decades thus indicating the urgent clinical need for the development of novel treatment strategies. Therefore, we have recently developed new preclinical models to study promising novel agents for the treatment of pediatric osteosarcoma. The checkpoint kinase (chk) inhibitor prexasertib (LY2606368) and its salt form (LSN2940930) have recently been shown to be active in adult and pediatric malignancies, including sarcoma. We have now tested the potency of prexasertib in clonogenic survival assays in two new lines of primary patient-derived osteosarcoma cells and in two established osteosarcoma cell lines as a single agent and in combination with cisplatin and the poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor talazoparib. Prexasertib alone results in strongly reduced clonogenic survival at low nanomolar concentrations and acts by affecting cell cycle progression, induction of apoptosis and induction of double-stranded DNA breakage at concentrations that are well below clinically tolerable and safe plasma concentrations. In combination with cisplatin and talazoparib, prexasertib acts in a synergistic fashion. Chk1 inhibition by prexasertib and its combination with the DNA damaging agent cisplatin and the PARP-inhibitor talazoparib thus emerges as a potential new treatment option for pediatric osteosarcoma which will now have to be tested in preclinical primary patient derived in vivo models and clinical studies."

We integrated 914 single-cell DNA methylomes, 55,284 single-cell transcriptomes, and bulk multi-omic profiles across 11 adult IDH-mutant or IDH-wild-type gliomas to delineate sources of intratumoral heterogeneity. We show that local DNA methylation disorder associates with cell-to-cell DNA methylation differences, is elevated in more aggressive tumors, links with transcriptional disruption, and is altered in environmental stress response. Glioma cells under in vitro hypoxic and irradiation stress increased local DNA methylation disorder and shifted cell states. We identified a positive association between genetic and epigenetic instability that was supported in bulk longitudinally collected DNA methylation data. Increased DNA methylation disorder associated with accelerated disease progression, and recurrently selected DNA methylation changes were enriched for environmental stress response pathways. Our work identifies an epigenetically facilitated adaptive stress response process and highlights the importance of epigenetic heterogeneity in shaping therapeutic outcomes."

Here, we took advantage of a large family carrying a balanced t(1;11) translocation, which substantially increases risk of MMI, to undertake both diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and cellular studies to evaluate the consequences of the t(1;11) translocation on white matter structural integrity and oligodendrocyte-myelin biology (this translocation disrupts among others the DISC1 gene which plays a crucial role in brain development).

This enrichment suggests that a proportion of associated variants is likely to confer disease risk by modulating gene-expression in CD4-positive subsets of T cells. Here, we aim to further study the effects of disease associated variants - specifically we want to assess if different alleles can lead to imbalanced histone modification levels, differences in chromatin open regions and altered gene expression. We will perform RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq on Tcells isolated from 100 healthy blood donors. All individuals will be also genotyped using a genome-wide array. We want to focus on the regulatory T cells in the first instance but also extend the analyses to other relevant CD4-positive subtypes where relevant.

EGAS00001002676,liver biopsy derived induced pluripotent stem cells provide  unlimited supply   generation  patient specific hepatocyte  cells,"Background: Hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have emerged as a promising cell culture model to study metabolism, biotransformation, viral infections and genetic liver diseases. However the derivation of iPSCs is restricted by ethical and procedural constraints. Furthermore, incomplete HLC differentiation remains a major challenge. iPSC may carry-on a tissue of origin dependent expression memory influencing iPSC differentiation into different cell types. If liver derived iPSCs (Li-iPSCs) maintain a liver specific gene expression profile is not known. It is also not known, if Li-iPSCs would allow the generation of more fully differentiated HLCs.Methods: Primary liver cells (PLCs) were expanded from liver needle biopsies and reprogrammed into Li-iPSCs using a non-integrative Sendai virus-based system. Li-iPSCs were differentiated into HLCs using established differentiation protocols. The HLC phenotype was characterized at the protein, functional and transcriptional level. RNA sequencing data were generated from the originating liver biopsies, the Li-iPSCs, fibroblast derived iPSCs, and differentiated HLCs, and used to characterize and compare their transcriptome profiles.Results: PLCs were obtained from small pieces of liver biopsies and could be reprogrammed into Li-iPSCs. Li-iPSCs indeed retain a liver specific transcriptional footprint. Li-iPSCs can be propagated to provide an unlimited supply of cells for differentiation into Li-HLCs. Similar to HLCs derived from fibroblasts, Li-HLCs could not be fully differentiated into hepatocytes. Relative to the originating liver, Li-HLCs showed lower expression of liver specific transcription factors and increased expression of genes involved in the differentiation of other tissues.Conclusions: PLCs and Li-iPSCs obtained from small pieces of human needle liver biopsies constitute a novel unlimited source for the production of HLCs. Despite the preservation of a liver specific gene expression footprint in Li-iPSCs, the generation of fully differentiated hepatocytes cannot be achieved with the current differentiation protocols."

MM relapse has higher mutational burden, associated with increased AID/APOBEC activity and DNA repair deficiency. In addition, we identified three major patterns of clonal evolution.

Employing substrate-linked directed molecular evolution, we developed a coupled heterodimeric recombinase system (RecF8) achieving 30% inversion of the target sequence in human tissue culture cells. Transient RecF8 treatment of endothelial cells, differentiated from patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of a hemophilic donor, resulted in 12% correction of the inversion and restored Factor VIII mRNA expression.

Escherichia coli can carry the pathogenicity island pks, which encodes a set of enzymes that synthesize colibactin. This compound is believed to alkylate DNA on adenine residues and induces double strand breaks in cultured cells. Here, we expose human intestinal organoids to genotoxic pks+ Escherichia coli by repeated luminal injection over a period of 5 months. Whole genome sequencing of clonal organoids before and after this exposure reveals a distinct mutational signature, absent from organoids injected with isogenic pks-mutant bacteria. The same mutational signature is detected in a subset of 5876 human cancer genomes from two independent cohorts, predominantly in CRC. Our study describes a distinct mutational signature in CRC and implies that the underlying mutational process directly results from past exposure to bacteria carrying the colibactin-producing pks pathogenicity island.

However, there are few data on vaccine efficacy in elderly individuals above the age of 801. Additionally, new variants of concern (VOC) with reduced sensitivity to neutralising antibodies have raised fears for vulnerable groups. Here we assessed humoral and cellular immune responses following vaccination with mRNA vaccine BNT162b22 in elderly participants prospectively recruited from the community and younger health care workers. Median age was 72 years and 51% were females amongst 140 participants. Neutralising antibody responses after the first vaccine dose diminished with increasing age, with a steep drop in participants over 80 years old. Sera from participants below and above 80 showed significantly lower neutralisation potency against B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1. variants of concern as compared to wild type. Those over 80 were more likely to lack any neutralisation against VOC compared younger participants following first dose. Binding IgG and IgA antibodies were lower in the elderly, as was the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 Spike specific B- cells. We observed a trend towards lower somatic hypermutation in participants with suboptimal neutralisation, and elderly participants demonstrated clear reduction in class switched somatic hypermutation, driven by the IgA1/2 isotype. SARS-CoV-2 Spike specific T- cell IFN?? and IL-2 responses were secreted primarily by CD4 T cells, and impaired in the older age group. We conclude that the elderly are a high risk population that warrant specific measures in order to mitigate against vaccine failure, particularly where variants of concern are circulating.

We used deep targeted sequencing to reconstruct tumor evolution in ten prostate cancer patients with fatal disease encompassing examination of the prostate and adjacent and distant organs, as well as plasma, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid at various time points. We show that there is substantial evolution from a common ancestor within the prostate that results in branching to multiple lineages which form an intermixed multi-clonal primary tumor mass. After the occurrence of key driver aberrations, one of these lineages will metastasize to multiple sites in a sequential fashion. These metastatic sites are then susceptible to being populated by cells from other intra-prostatic lineages or from other metastases. Genomic representation of metastases in body fluids is not uniform. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis can detect lineages not detected in circulating DNA, suggesting possible clinical utility."

Led by Mike Stratton, together with Paul Brennan, Ludmil Alexandrov, Allan Balmain, David Phillips and Peter Campbell, this large-scale international research endeavour was awarded a Cancer Research UK Grand Challenge. 

Different patterns of somatic mutation are generated by the different environmental, lifestyle and genetic factors that cause cancer, many of them are still unknown. Within Mutographs, the International Agency for Research on Cancer is coordinating the recruitment of 5000 individuals with cancer (colorectal, renal, pancreatic, oesophageal adenocarcinoma or oesophageal squamous cancers) across 5 continents to explore whether different mutational signatures explain marked variation in incidence. In brief, through an international network of collaborators around the world, biological materials are collected, along with demographic, histological, clinical and questionnaire data. Whole genome sequences of tumour-germline DNA pairs are generated at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (Illumina HiSeqX, 40X and 20X depth respectively). Somatic mutational signatures are subsequently extracted by non-negative matrix factorisation methods and correlated with risk factors data. 

Through an enhanced understanding of cancer aetiology, Mutographs unprecedented effort is anticipated to outline modifiable risk factors, lead to new approaches to prevent cancer, and provide opportunities to empower early detection, refine high-risk groups and contribute to further therapeutic development."

To gain insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms, we created the Translational human pancreatic Islet Genotype tissue-Expression Resource (TIGER), aggregating &gt;500 human islet RNA-seq and genotyping datasets. We imputed genotypes using 4 reference panels and meta-analyzed cohorts to improve coverage of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and developed a method to combine allele-specific expression across samples (cASE). We identified &gt;1 million islet eQTLs (56% novel), of which 53 colocalize with T2D signals (60% novel). Among them, a low-frequency allele that reduces T2D risk by half increases CCND2 expression. We identified 8 novel cASE colocalizations, among which an SLC30A8 T2D associated variant. We make all the data available through the open-access TIGER portal (http://tiger.bsc.es), which represents a comprehensive human islet genomic data resource to elucidate how genetic variation affects islet function and translate this into therapeutic insight and precision medicine for T2D."

However, it is still unclear whether RAS-mutations are associated with disease outcome. Specifically, no information exists whether KRAS-mutations have an impact on survival in MM patients at diagnosis that were treated with novel agents (e.g. bortezomib, lenalidomide). Targeting KRAS directly for therapeutic purposes is still impossible, but recently the first covalent mutant-specific inhibitor targeting KRASG12C made it into clinical trials. However, other KRAS-hotspot-mutations exist in MM patients, including the less common exon4-mutations. Within the current study, the coding regions of KRAS in 80 MM patients at diagnosis, uniformly treated with bortezomib and high-dose chemotherapy, were deep-sequenced. Moreover, the functional impact of KRASG12A as well as the two exon4-mutations A146T (AMO1) and A146V (MM patient) on different survival pathways was investigated. Specifically, an siRNA-mediated knockdown in AMO1 was performed and KRASWT, KRASG12A, KRAS146T and KRAS146V were overexpressed in the KRASWT cell lines JJN3 and OPM2 using lentiviral transduction and the transposase based Sleeping Beauty system. KRAS-mutations were not associated with survival. Yet, the expression of all KRAS-mutants had an impact on MEK/ERK-signaling in two independent MM cell lines and on AKT/PI3K-signaling in one MM cell line."

Using whole exome sequencing, compound heterozygous variants were identified in SLC5A6, which encodes the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT) protein. SMVT is an important transporter of the B-group vitamins biotin, pantothenate and lipoate. The protein is ubiquitously expressed and has major roles in vitamin uptake in the digestive system, as well as transport of these vitamins across the blood-brain barrier. Pathogenicity of the identified variants was demonstrated by impaired biotin uptake of mutant SMVT. Identification of this vitamin transporter as the genetic basis of this disorder guided targeted therapeutic intervention, resulting clinically in improvement of the patient’s neurocognitive and neuromotor function. This is the second report of biallelic mutations in SLC5A6 leading to a neurodegenerative disorder due to impaired biotin, pantothenate and lipoate uptake. The genetic and phenotypic overlap of these cases confirms mutations in SLC5A6 as the genetic cause of this disease phenotype. Recognition of the genetic disorder caused by SLC5A6 mutations is essential for early diagnosis and to facilitate timely intervention by triple vitamin (biotin, pantothenate and lipoate) replacement therapy."

EGAS00001002582,inhibiton   gabpb1l  gabp tetramer  sufficient  reverse replicative immortality  tert promoter mutant glioblastoma cells,"Over 50 types of cancer acquire TERT promoter mutations. These single point mutations reactivate telomerase, allowing for indefinite maintenance of telomere length and enabling cellular immortalization. The transcription factor binding site created by the point mutations specifically recruit the ETS factor GABP, a multimeric transcription factor composed of the GABPα and GABPβ subunits. GABP can form two functionally independent transcription factor species – a dimer or a tetramer – depending on which of the structurally distinct GABPβ isoforms is incorporated into the complex. In this study, we show that genetic disruption of GABPβ1L, a tetramer forming isoform of GABPβ that is dispensable in normal development, results in TERT silencing in a TERT promoter mutation dependent manner. Failure to activate TERT expression by GABPβ1L culminates in telomere dysfunction, DNA damage, and mitotic cell death exclusively in TERT promoter mutant cells. Furthermore, exogenous expression of TERT is sufficient to prevent telomere degradation and loss of cell viability in GABPβ1L-reduced lines bearing the mutant TERT promoter. Orthotopic injection of tetramer-deficient mutant TERT promoter GBM cells rendered lower tumor burden and prolonged the overall survival of the tumor-bearing mice. These results highlight the potentially widespread role of GABPB1L in enabling replicative immortality of TERT promoter cancers."

Although abnormalities in a hostâ€™s systemic immunity are associated with increased cancer susceptibility, the functional interplay between tumor cells and circulating immune cells in regulating tumorigenic responses is unclear. We employed the Norwegian Women and Cancer study, a large prospective population-based cohort study, to identify gene expression changes in blood cells that provide a robust and reproducible diagnostic signal specific to breast cancer patients. We further show that circulating blood cells in breast cancer patients are enriched in genes involved in systemic immunosuppression and the motility, metabolism, growth, and proliferation of immune cells. By mining of the cancer-associated blood transcriptome, we identified immune mediators or biomarkers that could permit early detection of breast cancer and open avenues to novel targeted immunotherapies."

Our previous map of global gene expression based on approximately 400K SNPs and 50K transcripts in 400 sib pairs from the MRCA family panel has been widely used to interpret the results of GWAS. Here, we more than double the size of our initial dataset with expression data on 550 additional individuals from the MRCE family panel using the Illumina whole genome expression array. We have used new statistical methods for dimension reduction to account for non-genetic effects in estimates of expression levels and we have also included SNPs imputed from the 1000 Genomes Project. Our methods reduced false discovery rates and increased the number of eQTLs mapped either locally or at a distance (i.e. in cis or trans) from 1,534 in the MRCA dataset to 4,452 (with <5% FDR). Imputation of 1000 Genomes SNPs further increased the number of eQTLs to 7,302. Using the same methods and imputed SNPs in the newly acquired MRCE dataset we identified eQTLs for 9000 genes. The combined results identify strong local and distant effects for transcripts from 14,177 genes.

Identifying a biomarker that predicts risk of developing TMZ-associated hypermutation may inform patient monitoring and treatment decisions, ultimately improving clinical management for LGG. MGMT encodes O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, a DNA repair protein that removes cytotoxic and potentially mutagenic lesions induced by TMZ. Here, we conduct a hypothesis-driven investigation of MGMT promoter methylation level in initial LGG tumors as a predictor of TMZ-associated hypermutation at recurrence. We characterize MGMT promoter methylation in tissue samples from initial tumors and recurrences using a quantitative, high-throughput deep sequencing assay. We evaluate hypermutation status in tumors by exome sequencing. In our patient cohort, average methylation level at the MGMT promoter is significantly higher in initial tumors of patients that develop hypermutation at recurrence relative to initial tumors of patients that do not. Methylation level in initial tumors can predict hypermutation at recurrence in univariate models and multivariate models that incorporate patient age and molecular subtype. MGMT promoter methylation level in initial tumors of LGG patients is a significant predictor of TMZ-associated hypermutation at recurrence and may serve as a clinical biomarker for informing patient monitoring and treatment decisions."

Proponents have pointed to the existence of New World crops, such as the sweet potato and bottle gourd, in the Polynesian archaeological record, but nowhere else outside the pre-Columbian Americas while critics have argued that these botanical dispersals need not have been human mediated. The Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl controversially suggested that prehistoric South American populations had an important role in the settlement of east Polynesia and particularly of Easter Island (Rapa Nui). Several limited molecular genetic studies have reached opposing conclusions, and the possibility continues to be as hotly contested today as it was when first suggested. Here we analyse genome-wide variation in individuals from islands across Polynesia for signs of Native American admixture, analysing 807 individuals from 17 island populations and 15 Pacific coast Native American groups. We find conclusive evidence for prehistoric contact of Polynesian individuals with Native American individuals (around AD 1200) contemporaneous with the settlement of remote Oceania. Our analyses suggest strongly that a single contact event occurred in eastern Polynesia, before the settlement of Rapa Nui, between Polynesian individuals and a Native American group most closely related to the indigenous inhabitants of present-day Colombia."

Orthotopic transplantation of NES cells generated from Gorlin syndrome, patients predisposed to medulloblastoma due to germline mutated PTCH1, also generated medulloblastoma.

The basis for this increase, and in particular the source of the extra cfDNA in such patients, has never been determined. To address this issue, we assessed methylation patterns of cfDNA from 57 individuals, 34 of whom had unequivocally elevated cfDNA concentrations (i.e., &gt;15 ng/mL of plasma). We found that the excess cfDNA in cancer patients did not come from either neoplastic cells or surrounding cells from the tumor's tissue of origin. Instead, 80% of the cfDNA was derived from neutrophils, B cells or T cells, with neutrophils accounting for ~2/3. B cells contributed more than T cells despite the great excess of T cells over B cells in the blood. To see if this result was generalizable to other clinical situations in which elevated cfDNA concentrations have been described, we evaluated nine patients before and one day following surgery. After surgical resection, cfDNA concentration increased by an average of 16.1-fold, as expected. The majority of this increase (55%) was contributed by leukocytes, though damaged hepatocytes contributed a substantial minority (31% of increase). These data suggest that the elevated concentrations of cfDNA in cancer patients, as with patients after surgery, arises largely from dying leukocytes—not from the neoplastic cells or the tissue of origin of the cancer."

EGAS00001004605,healthy aging thymus,"Single cell RNA sequencing of immune and non-immune cells from healthy ageing thymus

Thymus is a primary lymphoid organ that creates an environment for the T lymphocyte precursors differentiation into the naive T cells, which involves TCR gene rearrangement, negative and positive selection. Despite thymus critical function for the recognition of the pathogens it starts to atrophy very early in life. Thymic Epithelial Space (TES), where thymocyte education occurs, starts to decline rapidly just after birth, while with the onset of puberty thymus  is also progressively replaced with adipose tissue. This leads to a reduced naive T cell output,which decreases an organism's ability to recognize pathogens.
In our lab, we have already collected and characterized cell type composition and gene regulatory networks of the fetal tand adult human thymus (Park et al, Science 2020). In the current project we plan to expand the number of paediatric and adult samples in the study with the aim to understand how the process of thymic involution happens. We will use single-cell transcriptomics to zoom on changes that occur in immune and non-immune cell types in different phases of thymic involution with the hope to understand which gene expression changes are causal for the thymic involution process and how naïve T cell production can be increased in elderly.

Here, we analyzed 592 tumors collected from advanced ccRCC patients enrolled in prospective clinical trials of treatment with PD-1 blockade (or mTOR inhibition as control arm) by whole-exome and RNA-sequencing, integrated with immunofluorescence analysis, to define the somatic alteration landscape of late-stage ccRCC and to uncover the immunogenomic determinants of therapeutic response. While conventional genomic markers (tumor mutation burden, neoantigen load) and degree of CD8+ T cell infiltration were not associated with clinical response, we discovered numerous chromosomal alterations in advanced ccRCC associated with response or resistance to PD-1 blockade. These advanced tumors were highly CD8+ T cell infiltrated, with only 22% and 5% with an immune desert and immune excluded phenotype, respectively. Our analysis revealed that CD8+ infiltrated tumors are depleted of favorable PBRM1 mutations and are enriched for unfavorable chromosomal losses of 9p21.3 when compared to non-infiltrated tumors. These data demonstrate how the interplay of somatic alterations and immunophenotypes impacts therapeutic efficacy."

Today, among large communities in Southeast Asia, the Peranakans have preserved Chinese traditions with strong influence from the local indigenous Malays. Yet, whether or to what extent genetic admixture co-occurred with the cultural mixture has been a topic of ongoing debate. We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on 177 Singapore (SG) Peranakans and analyzed the data jointly with WGS data of Asian and European populations. We estimated that Peranakan Chinese inherited ~5.62% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.75-6.46%) Malay ancestry, much higher than that in SG Chinese (1.08%, 0.69-1.53%), southern Chinese (0.86%, 0.57-1.31%), and northern Chinese (0.25%, 0.18-0.33%). A sex-biased admixture history, in which the Malay ancestry was contributed primarily by females, was supported by X chromosomal variants, and mitochondrial (MT) and Y haplogroups. Finally, we identified an ancient admixture event shared by Peranakan Chinese and SG Chinese ~1,612 (95% CI: 1,345-1,923) years ago, coinciding with the settlement history of Han Chinese in southern China, apart from the recent admixture event with Malays unique to Peranakan Chinese ~190 (159-213) years ago. These findings greatly advance our understanding of the dispersal history of Chinese and their interaction with indigenous populations in Southeast Asia."

EGAS00001003973,direct comparative analysis  10x genomics chromium  smart seq2,"Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is widely used for profiling transcriptomes of individual cells. The droplet-based 10X Genomics Chromium (10X) approach and the plate-based Smart-seq2 full-length method are two frequently-used scRNA-seq platforms, yet there are only a few thorough and systematic comparisons of their advantages and limitations. Here, by directly comparing the scRNA-seq data by the two platforms from the same samples of CD45- cells, we systematically evaluated their features using a wide spectrum of analysis. Smart-seq2 detected more genes in a cell, especially low abundance transcripts as well as alternatively spliced transcripts, but captured higher proportion of mitochondrial genes. The composite of Smart-seq2 data also resembled bulk RNA-seq data better. For 10X-based data, we observed higher noise for mRNA in the low expression level. Despite the poly(A) enrichment, approximately 10-30% of all detected transcripts by both platforms were from non-coding genes, with lncRNA accounting for a higher proportion in 10X. 10X-based data displayed more severe dropout problem, especially for genes with lower expression levels. However, 10X-data can better detect rare cell types given its ability to cover a large number of cells. In addition, each platform detected different sets of differentially expressed genes between cell clusters, indicating the complementary nature of these technologies.

EGAS00001003975,mutational landscape  patterns  clonal evolution  relapsed pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"Relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains a leading cause of childhood death. Prior studies have shown clonal mutations at relapse often arise from relapse-fated subclones that exist at diagnosis. However, the genomic landscape, evolutionary trajectories and mutational mechanisms driving relapse are incompletely understood. In an analysis of 92 cases of relapsed childhood ALL, incorporating multimodal DNA and RNA sequencing, deep digital mutational tracking and xenografting to formally define clonal structure, we identify 50 significant targets of mutation with distinct patterns of mutational acquisition or enrichment. CREBBP, NOTCH1, and Ras signaling mutations rose from diagnosis subclones, whereas variants in NCOR2, USH2A and NT5C2 were exclusively observed at relapse. Evolutionary modeling and xenografting demonstrated that relapse-fated clones were minor (50%), major (27%) or multiclonal (18%) at diagnosis. Putative second leukemias, including those with lineage shift, were shown to most commonly represent relapse from an ancestral clone rather than a truly independent second primary leukemia. A subset of leukemias prone to repeated relapse exhibited hypermutation driven by at least three distinct mutational processes, resulting in heightened neoepitope burden and potential vulnerability to immunotherapy. Finally, relapse-driving sequence mutations were detected prior to relapse using deep digital PCR at levels comparable to orthogonal approaches to monitor levels of measurable residual disease. These results provide a genomic framework to anticipate and circumvent relapse by earlier detection and targeting of relapse-fated clones."

Better knowledge of molecular and cellular intra-tumor heterogeneity throughout the thoracic cavity is required to develop efficient therapies. This study focuses on molecular intra-tumor heterogeneity using the largest series to date in MPM and is the first to report on the multi-omics profiling of a substantial series of multi-site tumor samples. Methods:Intra-tumor heterogeneity was investigated in 16 patients from whom biopsies were taken at distinct anatomical sites. The paired biopsies collected from apex, side wall, costo-diaphragmatic or highest metabolic sites as well as 5 derived cell lines were screened using targeted sequencing. Whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and DNA methylation were performed on a subset of the cohort for deep characterization. Molecular classification, recently defined histo-molecular gradients, and cell populations of the tumor microenvironment were assessed. Results:Sequencing analysis identified heterogeneous variants notably in NF2, a key tumor suppressor gene of mesothelial carcinogenesis. Subclonal tumor populations were shared among paired biopsies, suggesting a polyclonal dissemination of the tumor. Transcriptome analysis highlighted dysregulation of cell adhesion and extracellular matrix pathways, linked to changes in histo-molecular gradient proportions between anatomic sites. Methylome analysis revealed contribution of epigenetic mechanisms in two patients. Finally, significant changes in the expression of immune mediators and genes related to immunological synapse, as well as differential infiltration of immune populations in the tumor environment were observed and led to a switch from a hot to a cold immune profile in three patients.  Conclusions:This comprehensive analysis reveals patient-dependent spatial intra-tumor heterogeneity at the genetic, transcriptomic and epigenetic levels and in the immune landscape of the tumor microenvironment.

We recently reported novel recurrent nonsynonymous mutations in the MYO5B gene in metastatic PPGL. Here, we explored the functional impact of these MYO5B mutations, and analyzed MYO5B expression in primary PPGL tumor cases in relation to mutation status.Immunohistochemistry and mRNA expression analysis in 30 primary PPGL tumors revealed an increased MYO5B expression in metastatic compared to non-metastatic tumor cases. In addition, subcellular localization of MYO5B protein was altered from cytoplasmatic to membranous in some metastatic tumors, and the strongest and most abnormal expression pattern was observed in a PGL case harboring a MYO5B:p.G1611S mutation. Mutation analysis of additional PPGL tumors revealed additional, and hence recurrent, mutations in the paralog MYO5A. Three missense mutations in MYO5B were functionally studied using site directed mutagenesis and stable transfection into human neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-AS) and embryonic kidney cells (HEK293 cell line). Functional analysis of the mutants verified a significant increased proliferation rate in all MYO5B mutated clones (p.L587P,  p.G1611S, and p.R1641C).  The two somatically derived mutations p.L587P and p.G1611S were also found to increase the migration rate, and all three mutants affected intracellular transport by increased transferrin uptake. Downstream expression analysis of MYO5B mutants demonstrated a transcriptional activation of genes involved in glucose metabolism, proliferation, homeostasis, and migration. Our study validates the functional role of novel MYO5B mutations in proliferation and migration, and suggest the MYO5-pathway to be involved the malignant progression of PPGL tumors."

Patient-derived cells (PDC) that model the genetically distinct hypermutated (HM) tumor subgroup are generally lacking, and few if any human brain tumor cell models are from defined evolutionary time points. Here, we characterize multiple PDC derived from independent surgical specimens of IDH1-mutant recurrences, including an ATRX and TP53-mutant astrocytoma and a 1p/19q co-deleted and TERT promoter-mutant oligodendroglioma. We determined the evolutionary time points represented by each PDC using exome sequencing and phylogenetic reconstruction, comparing the PDC and single cell clones of the PDC (scPDC) to multiple spatiotemporal tumor tissue samples, PDC-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-matched blood. The tumor samples exhibited TMZ-induced mutagenesis and a branching pattern of evolution. We found clear evidence of two fully independent founder HM clones in the tumor tissue that are faithfully represented by independent PDC. The PDC, scPDC and PDX also shared the mutagenesis signature and represent the mid and later evolutionary time points of their corresponding tumors. The PDC maintained the tumor subtype-defining features over many passages, including heterozygosity of the IDH1 R132H mutation, production of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), and subtype-specific telomere maintenance mechanisms. The PDC from both tumors exhibited anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. The oligodendroglioma PDC formed infiltrative intracranial tumors with characteristic oligodendroglioma histology, initially with a long period to tumor formation. We conclude that the PDC, scPDC and PDX faithfully model the heterogeneous clonal origins of the corresponding tumor tissue. The multilevel analysis also provides new insight into the intratumoral heterogeneity and vast mutational load of HM glioma. The PDC from multiple evolutionary time points presented in the context of full clinical timelines may be useful to model evolution and intratumoral heterogeneity, important sources of therapeutic failure."

This is of uttermost importance given the current lack of human hypoblast stem cells. 

We hypothesized that the pluripotent characteristics of the starting human embryonic stem cell population may dictate the competency for extra-embryonic cell fate specification. Based on this hypothesis and using human embryonic stem cells maintained in different naïve-like culture regimes, we have now developed conditions that allow the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to a stable GATA6+ SOX2- population. This suggests that these cells may be putative human hypoblast stem cells. To validate this finding here we propose to perform RNA sequencing experiments of the differentiated human embryonic stem cells. By comparing their RNA expression profile to the single cell sequencing data of the human embryo that we are currently generating, we will be able to determine the identity of our GATA6+ SOX2- cells, and establish whether they represent the in vivo human hypoblast."

implementation of risk-adapted therapy has been instrumental in the dramatic improvements in
clinical outcomes. A key to risk-adapted therapies includes the identification of genomic features of
individual tumors, including chromosome number (for hyper- and hypodiploidy) and gene fusions,
notably ETV6-RUNX1, TCF3-PBX1 and BCR-ABL1 in B-cell ALL (B-ALL). RNA-sequencing
(RNA-seq) of large ALL cohorts has expanded the number of recurrent gene fusions recognized as
drivers in ALL, and identification of these new entities will contribute to refining ALL risk
stratification. We used RNA-seq on 126 ALL patients from our clinical service to test the utility of
including RNA-seq in standard of care diagnostic pipelines to detect gene rearrangements and
IKZF1 deletions. RNA-seq identified 86% of rearrangements detected by standard of care
diagnostics. KMT2A-rearrangements (MLL), whilst usually identified, were the most commonly
missed by RNA-seq as a result of low expression. RNA-seq identified rearrangements that were not
detected by standard of care testing in nine patients. These were found in patients who were not
classifiable using standard molecular assessment. We developed an approach to detect the
commonest IKZF1 deletion from RNA-seq data and validated this using a RQ-PCR assay. We
applied an expression classifier to identify Ph-like B-ALL patients. T-ALL proved a rich source of
novel gene fusions which have clinical implications or provide insights into disease biology. Our
experience shows that RNA-seq can be implemented within an individual clinical service to
enhance the current molecular diagnostic risk classification of ALL."

EGAS00001003964,partner independent fusion gene detection  multiplexed crispr cas9 enrichment  long read nanopore sequencing,"Fusion genes are hallmarks of various cancer types and important determinants for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment possibilities. The promiscuity of fusion genes with respect to partner choice and exact breakpoint-positions restricts their detection in the diagnostic setting, even for known and recurrent fusion gene configurations. To accurately identify these gene fusions in an unbiased manner, we developed FUDGE: a FUsion gene Detection assay from Gene Enrichment. FUDGE couples target-selected and strand-specific CRISPR/Cas9 activity for enrichment and detection of fusion gene drivers (e.g. BRAF, EWSR1, KMT2A/MLL) - without prior knowledge of fusion partner or breakpoint-location -  to long-read Nanopore sequencing. FUDGE encompasses a dedicated bioinformatics approach (NanoFG) to detect fusion genes from Nanopore sequencing data. Our strategy is flexible with respect to target choice and enables multiplexed enrichment for simultaneous analysis of several genes in multiple samples in a single sequencing run. We observe on average a 508-fold on-target enrichment and identify fusion breakpoints at nucleotide resolution - all within two days. We demonstrate that FUDGE effectively identifies fusion genes in cancer cell lines, tumor samples and on whole genome amplified DNA irrespective of partner gene or breakpoint-position in 100% of cases. Furthermore, we show that FUDGE is superior to routine diagnostic methods for fusion gene detection. In summary, we have developed a rapid and versatile fusion gene detection assay, providing an unparalleled opportunity for pan-cancer detection of fusion genes in routine diagnostics."

We analyzed 489 CCAs from 10 countries, combining whole-genome (71 cases), targeted/exome, copy-number, gene expression, and DNA methylation information. Integrative clustering defined 4 CCA clusters-fluke-positive CCAs (clusters 1/2) are enriched in ERBB2 amplifications and TP53 mutations; conversely, fluke-negative CCAs (clusters 3/4) exhibit high copy-number alterations and PD-1/PD-L2 expression, or epigenetic mutations (IDH1/2, BAP1) and FGFR/PRKA-related gene rearrangements. Whole-genome analysis highlighted FGFR2 3' untranslated region deletion as a mechanism of FGFR2 upregulation. Integration of noncoding promoter mutations with protein-DNA binding profiles demonstrates pervasive modulation of H3K27me3-associated sites in CCA. Clusters 1 and 4 exhibit distinct DNA hypermethylation patterns targeting either CpG islands or shores-mutation signature and subclonality analysis suggests that these reflect different mutational pathways. Our results exemplify how genetics, epigenetics, and environmental carcinogens can interplay across different geographies to generate distinct molecular subtypes of cancer.SIGNIFICANCE: Integrated whole-genome and epigenomic analysis of CCA on an international scale identifies new CCA driver genes, noncoding promoter mutations, and structural variants.

Such procedures inadvertently induce DNA fragmentation, which compromises sequencing-based analyses of chromosomal rearrangements. Yet, rearrangements drive many types of hematolymphoid malignancies and solid tumors, and their manifestation is instructive for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Here, we present FFPE-Targeted Locus Capture (FFPE-TLC) for targeted sequencing of proximity-ligation products formed in FFPE tissue blocks, and PLIER, a computational framework that allows automated identification and characterization of rearrangements involving selected, clinically-relevant, loci. FFPE-TLC, blindly applied to 149 lymphoma and control FFPE samples, identifies the known and novel rearrangement partners. It outperforms fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in sensitivity and specificity, and shows clear advantages over standard capture-NGS methods, finding rearrangements involving repetitive sequences which they typically miss.

A high degree of tumor-type and subtype specific recurrencies suggest a selective oncogenic advantage. However, due to their large size it has been difficult to pinpoint the oncogenic drivers that confer this advantage. Suitable functional genomics approaches to study the oncogenic driving capacity of arm-level deletions are limited. Here we present an effective technique to engineer arm-level deletions by CRISPR-Cas9 and create isogenic cell line models. We simultaneously induce double-strand breaks (DSBs) at two ends of a chromosomal arm and select the cells that have lost the intermittent region. Using this technique, we induced arm-level deletions on chromosome 11q (65 MB) and chromosome 6q (53 MB) in neuroblastoma cell lines.

We identified transcriptionally distinct malignant subclones and compared their drug response and genomic profiles. Malignant subclones of the same patient responded strikingly different to anti-cancer drugs ex vivo, which recapitulated subclone-specific drug sensitivity during in vivo treatment. Tumor infiltrating T cells represented the majority of non-malignant cells, whose gene expression signatures were similar across all donors, whereas the frequencies of T cell subsets varied significantly between the donors.

However, its effect has not been tested in patient-derived glioblastoma stem cells. Immunohistochemistry and public data were analyzed to determine whether NEDD8 pathway proteins are important in glioblastoma development and patient survival.

In contrast, various loss-of-function mutations in FOXL2 lead to the development of blepharophimosis, ptosis and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). BPES is characterized by an eyelid malformation often accompanied with primary ovarian insufficiency but not granulosa cell tumours. Two recent studies suggest that FOXL2 C402G is a gain or change-of-function mutation with altered DNA-binding specificity. Another study proposes that FOXL2 C402G is selectively targeted for degradation inducing somatic haploinsufficiency suggesting its role as a tumour suppressor. The latter study relies on data indicative of an FOXL2 allelic imbalance in AGCTs. Here we present RNA-seq data as genetic evidence that no real allelic imbalance is observed at the transcriptomic level in AGCTs. Additionally, there is no loss of protein expression in tumours harboring the mutated allele. These data and other features of this mutation as compared to other oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes argue strongly against FOXL2 being a tumour suppressor in this context. Given the likelihood that FOXL2 C402G is oncogenic, targeting the variant protein or its downstream consequences is the most viable path forward to identifying an effective treatment for this cancer."

To address the combinatorial explosion in the number of relevant combinations, we implemented a machine learning approach that prioritizes patient-customized drug combinations with a desired synergy-efficacy-toxicity balance by combining single-cell RNA-sequencing with ex vivo single-agent testing in scarce patient-derived primary cells. When applied to two diagnostic and two refractory AML patient cases, each with a different genetic background, our integrated approach accurately predicted patient-specific combinations that were shown to result not only in synergistic cancer cell co-inhibition but were also capable of targeting specific AML cell subpopulations that emerge in differing stages of disease pathogenesis or treatment regimens.

Our aim is to characterise the transcriptional consequences of tauopathies using neurons derived from differentiated IPSCs as a model system. We will use IPS cells derived from six individuals, four with known mutations in the tau protein, 2 without. RNA will be extracted at Day 0 and Day 65 of differentiation by which time the neuronal tauopathy is apparent. RNA will be extracted and the transcriptome of each line characterised using RNAseq. We will then search for genes that are differentially expressed between the transcriptomes of individuals with tau mutations versus those in controls. My lab will analyse the RNAseq data, comparing both affected and controls and both time-points, to establish candidate genes. Darren Logan’s lab, along with our collaborators, will experimentally verify and further investigate these genes in additional lines and animal models. From this analysis we will generate a list of candidate genes that are differentially expressed between cases and controls. This study will not only help us understand the molecular basis of tauopathies, but also identify gene candidates for biomarkers of neurodegenerative disease.

EGAS00001000408,targeted sequencing  genes recurrently mutated  aml,"Background Massively parallel sequencing technology has transformed cancer genomics. It is now feasible, in a clinically relevant time-frame, for a clinically manageable cost, to screen DNA from patient tumours for mutations essentially genome-wide. The challenge for personalised medicine will be to increase the sample size to thousands or tens of thousands of well-characterised cases in order to attain sufficient statistical power to stratify patients accurately across the complexity and genomic heterogeneity expected for most of the common tumour types. Currently, whole genome sequencing on this scale is not feasible, and targeted sequencing of relevant portions of the genome will be required. Pilot data We have developed protocols for large-scale, multiplexed sequencing of 100-200 genes in thousands of samples. Essentially, using robotic technology, genomic DNA from the cancer specimen is processed into sequencing libraries with unique DNA barcodes, thereby allowing sequencing reads to be attributed to the sample they derive from. Currently, these sequencing libraries can be generated in a 96-well format using fully automated protocols, and we are exploring methods to expand this to a 384-well format. The sequencing libraries are pooled and hybridized to custom sets of RNA baits representing the genomic regions of interest. Sequencing of the pulled-down libraries is done in pools of 48-96 samples per lane of an Illumina Hi-Seq. This protocol is already implemented at the Sanger Institute. We have published proof that somatic mutations in novel cancer genes can be identified from exome-wide sequencing. In unpublished pilot data, we have established the feasibility of robotic library production, custom pull-down, and multiplexed sequencing of barcoded libraries for 100 known myeloid cancer genes across 760 myelodysplasia samples. Highlights of the data thus far analysed reveal that the coverage is remarkably even between samples; when 96 samples are run, average coverage per lane of sequencing is ~250, with 90-95% of targeted exons covered by &gt;25 reads; known mutations can be discovered in the data set; and the protocol is amenable to whole genome amplified DNA. The bioinformatic algorithms for identification of substitutions and indels in pull-down data are well-established; we have pilot data proving that copy number changes, LOH and genomic rearrangements in specific regions of interest can also be identified by tiling of baits across the relevant loci. Proposal We propose to apply this methodology to 10000 samples from patients with AML enrolled in clinical trials over the last 10-20 years. Oncogenic point mutations and potentially genomic rearrangements will be identified, and linked to clinical outcome data, with a view to undertaking the following sorts of analyses: • Identification of co-occurrence, mutual exclusivity and clusters of driver mutations. • Correlation of prognosis with driver mutations and potentially gene-gene interactions • Exploration of genomic markers of drug response Ultimately, we would like to be in a position to release the mutation data together with matched clinical outcome data to genuine medical researchers via a controlled access approach, possibly within the COSMIC framework (www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/). The vision here is to generate a portal whereby a clinician faced with an AML patient and his / her mutational profile can obtain a ‘personalised’ prediction of outcome, together with a fair assessment of the uncertainty of the estimate. With a sufficient sample size, there would also be the potential to develop decision support algorithms for therapeutic choices based on such data."

Allogeneic thymus transplantation is the only curative therapy for complete DiGeorge Syndrome (cDGS), a rare severe primary immunodeficiency characterised by athymia.  GOSH is one of only two centres worldwide to offer this treatment. Despite a lack of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matching between donor and host, transplanted thymus becomes repopulated by recipient bone marrow derived precursor cells and supports development of functional T-cells. The mechanisms underlying thymopoiesis in this context are poorly understood, but over time we observe reconstitution of T-cell immunity, with the ability to produce host naïve T-cells showing a broad T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and to generate MHC-restricted T-cell proliferative responses. Although lifesaving, the achieved immunological reconstitution is typically not complete with circulating T-cell numbers usually remaining below the age related normal ranges. Additionally, we observe persistence of donor-derived T-cells of unknown clinical significance. To gain more insight into the mechanisms by which MHC-mismatched transplanted thymus supports T-cell development with self-tolerance, as well as into the basis of suboptimal T-cell immunity, we now aim to investigate immune reconstitution after thymus transplantation in further detail by using single-cell transcriptomics, applied to thymic transplant biopsies and peripheral blood samples collected during standard post-transplant patient care. By identifying which lineages of host- derived cells repopulate the thymic tissue after transplantation, we will be able to address the role of MHC in positive and negative T-cell selection during T-cell differentiation. We will also be able to clarify the exact ontogeny of the persistent donor T-cells, as well as their possible role. Understanding the mechanisms of action of HLA-mismatched transplanted thymus will contribute to treatment optimisation. Additionally, our research provides a unique opportunity to further investigate key immunological concepts, such as tolerance and autoimmunity, challenging existing paradigms in thymus immunology.

Here we report the results of profiling miRNA expression in 1,302 breast tumors with detailed clinical annotation and long-term follow-up, and for which matching genomic and mRNA expression data were available7. This provides a comprehensive view of the quantity, distribution and variation of the miRNA population and dissects how much genomic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional events contribute to miRNA expression architecture. The key clinical parameters and cellular pathways related to the miRNA landscape are identified, exemplified by context-dependent interaction with cell adhesion and Wnt signaling. Strikingly, in breast cancer miRNAs appear to act as modulators of mRNA-mRNA interactions rather than molecular switches. We demonstrate an important modulatory role for miRNAs in the biology of breast tumors devoid of somatic copy number aberrations, a common subtype where immune response is prominent. Remarkably, prognostic miRNA signatures derived in this subtype are consistently prognostic across several other subtypes and validate in external cohorts. These findings represent a new framework to study the biology of miRNA in human cancer.

EGAS00001003019,german early onset prostate cancer cohort   pan prostate cancer genome ppcg project deprecated,"Prostate cancer is the most frequent malignant tumor in males and the second most frequent cause of cancer-related death. Currently, in Germany, more than 60,000 prostate cancers are diagnosed every year. Although most of these patients are treated in a curative attempt, more than 10,000 German men die from prostate cancer annually. Owing to the demographic changes of our society, a further doubling of prostate cancer incidences during the next 20 years is expected. Prostate cancer is generally considered a tumor of elderly men. However, a fraction of prostate cancers are diagnosed at the age of 55 years or less. For several reasons, these “early onset prostate cancers” may represent a key entity for the understanding of prostate cancer biology.First, it is likely that early onset prostate cancers represent a distinct molecular subgroup of prostate cancer (PCa), potentially characterized by relatively small numbers of genetic changes, some of which may be particularly strong driver mutations for PCa development. Second, a fraction of prostate cancers in young individuals could represent classical prostate cancers that are detected at a very early stage and might therefore have accumulated molecular changes/mutations occurring that are most instrumental for prostate cancer early detection. Third, PCa with hereditary backgrounds are likely to accumulate in the age group below 55 years. A comparison with other sample sets (e.g. from other ICGC consortia), a systematic genomic analysis of young men with PCa could therefore lead to the detection of mechanisms for hereditary PCa. Fourth, a better understanding of these tumors is particularly relevant as finding optimal treatment regimens is most critical in young cancer patients.We are analyzing the entire genomic DNA sequences of at least 200 PCas (and matched non-tumorous DNA) of young men (≤ 55y), to at least 30 fold coverage, and integrate single-nucleotide variants and genomic structural variations with differential methylation, mRNA and miRNA expression data.Tissues were collected at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf.

DNA methylation profiling is an emerging approach in the clinical classification of brain tumors. The goal of this study is to investigate the effects of intratumoral heterogeneity on classification confidence.

Methods: We used neuronavigation to acquire 133 image-guided and spatially-separated stereotactic biopsy samples from 16 adult patients with a diffuse glioma (7 IDH-wildtype and 2 IDH-mutant glioblastoma, 6 diffuse astrocytoma, IDH-mutant and 1 oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant and 1p19q codeleted), which we characterized using DNA methylation arrays. Samples were obtained from regions with and without abnormalities on contrast enhanced T1 weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI. Methylation profiles were analyzed to devise a three-dimensional reconstruction of (epi)genetic heterogeneity. Tumor purity was assessed from clonal methylation sites.

Results: Molecular aberrations indicated that tumor was found outside imaging abnormalities, underlining the infiltrative nature of this tumor and the limitations of current routine imaging modalities. We demonstrate that tumor purity is highly variable between samples and explains a substantial part of apparent epigenetic spatial heterogeneity. We observed that DNA methylation subtypes are often, but not always, conserved in space taking tumor purity and prediction accuracy into account.

Conclusion: Our results underscore the infiltrative nature of diffuse gliomas and suggest that DNA methylation subtypes are relatively concordant in this tumor type, although some heterogeneity exists."

In this context, using transcriptomic approaches, the co-applicants were the first to identify differential gene signatures, or immune endotypes, correlating with outcome in sepsis, (Davenport E. et al, The Lancet Respiratory medicine, 2016); potentially providing a path to personalised treatment in sepsis. Specifically, this work defined two groups based on transcriptomic profiles: SRS group 1 being more associated with endotoxin tolerance demonstrating an immunosuppressed signature and is associated with higher mortality, whereas, SRS2 is more immune-heightened. However, despite the importance of these findings, previous studies have been underpowered, and limited in depth of data, to resolve these endophenotypes further. In this context, the Bioresource for Adult Infectious Disease (BioAID) offers substantial opportunities in terms of power, depth and breadth of data linked to biological samples of patients presenting acutely with the sepsis syndrome across the UK.  BioAID currently holds samples for DNA, RNA, serum and microbial isolates for more than 4,000 individuals (with a planned recruit of 10,000 individuals) and therefore provides a powerful resource for examining the underlying biology and correlates of sepsis syndrome with a view to informing early risk stratification of patients, need for critical care, and treatments.

The survival benefit of anti-VEGF therapy in mCRC patients is limited to a few months and acquired resistance mechanisms are greatly unknown. Using plasma DNA, we studied the evolution of tumor genomes in a cohort of patients with mCRC (n=150) and observed a recurrent focal amplification (8.7% of cases) on chromosome 13q12.2. Analysis of TCGA data (n=619) suggested an association with later stages, which we confirmed by longitudinal plasma analyses. We defined the minimally amplified region and studied the mechanistic consequences of copy number gain of the involved genes. The amplification of one gene, POLR1D, impacted cell proliferation, resulting in upregulation of VEGFA, an important regulator of angiogenesis which has been implicated in the resistance to bevacizumab. In several patients, we observed the emergence of this 13q12.2 amplicon under bevacizumab treatment, which was invariably associated with evolution of therapy resistance. Hence, we describe a novel resistance mechanism against a widely applied treatment in mCRC patients which will impact clinical management"

Although targeted analyses have shown the presence of specific genetic abnormalities such as IGH translocations, RB1 deletion, 1q gain, hyperdiploidy or RAS genes mutations, little is known about molecular mechanism of malignant transformation. We have performed whole exome sequencing together with SNP array analysis in 33 flow-cytometry separated abnormal PC samples of MGUS patients to describe somatic gene mutations and chromosome changes at the genome-wide level. Non-synonymous mutations (NS-SNVs) and copy number alterations (CNAs) were present in 97.0% and in 63.6% of cases, respectively. Importantly, the number of somatic mutations was significantly lower in MGUS compared to MM (p&lt;10-4) and we have identified 6 myeloma significantly mutated genes which are KRAS, NRAS, DIS3, HIST1H1E, EGR1 and LTB in the MGUS dataset. We also found a positive correlation with increasing chromosome changes and somatic mutations. IGH translocations were present in 27.3% of cases comprising t(4;14), t(11;14), t(14;16) or t(14;20) and were in a similar frequency to MM, which corresponded with primary lesion hypothesis.

Although the overall survival of children with solid tumors is 75%-80%, that of children with recurrent disease is below 30%. To capture the complexity and diversity of pediatric solid tumors and establish new models of recurrent disease, we developed a protocol to produce orthotopic patient-derived xenografts (O-PDXs) at diagnosis, recurrence, and autopsy. Tumor specimens were received from 168 patients, and 64 O-PDXs were established for 12 types of pediatric solid tumors. The origins of the O-PDX tumors were reflected in their gene-expression profiles and epigenomes.  Genomic profiling of the tumors, including detailed clonal analysis, was performed to determine whether the clonal population in the xenograft recapitulated the patient’s tumor. We identified several drug vulnerabilities and showed that the combination of a WEE1 inhibitor (AZD1775), irinotecan, and vincristine can lead to complete response in multiple rhabdomyosarcoma O-PDX tumors in vivo."

Here we show that in secondary immune reactions to the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, CD4+ TRM are mobilized into the blood within 16 to 48 hours after immunization. This mobilization of TRM is cognate: TRM recognizing other antigens are not mobilized, unless they cross-react with the vaccine. We also demonstrate through methylome analyses that TRM are mobilized from the bone marrow. These mobilized cells make significant contribution to the systemic immune reaction, as evidenced by their T-cell receptor Vβ clonotypes represented among the newly generated circulating memory T-cells, 14 days after vaccination. Thus, TRM of the bone marrow confer not only local, but also systemic immune memory."

While clinical risk scores and biomarkers allow the identification of patients with higher risk of CNS relapse, their predictive ability is low. Herein, we report findings from a comprehensive study examining gene expression changes, mutations and clonal evolution. Firstly, considering diagnostic samples from patients with CNS relapse, systemic relapse or no relapse, we found a striking enrichment of gene expression changes reflecting protein biosynthesis in patients who experienced CNS or systemic relapse. Furthermore, diagnostic specimens of relapsing cases were characterized by low immune infiltrates. The most discriminative gene feature in our analysis was SLAMF1, high expression of which was associated with favourable outcomes. Next, we assessed whether specific gene mutations were associated with subsequent CNS or systemic relapse. Activated B-cell-like genes such as PIM1, CD79B and PRDM1 were more frequently mutated in cases with CNS relapse, whereas TP53, BCL2 and FOXO1 mutations were associated with systemic relapse. Lastly, we performed tumor evolution analysis in five patients, identifying significant clonal divergence that accompanied CNS relapse. In summary, we identified both common biology underlying both CNS and systemic relapse, independent of cell-of-origin (COO), and specific COO-enriched gene mutations that conferred a higher risk of either CNS or systemic relapse. Moreover, we identified a pattern of clonal evolution that can explain difficulties in both predicting and treating CNS relapse."

In contrast, early circulating tumor DNA dynamics identify activity of rucaparib in cancers with mutation-signatures of HR deficiency, with rucaparib inducing expression of interferon response genes in HR deficient cancers.

The kidneys play a critical role in homeostasis, excreting waste and acid and maintaining electrolyte and water balance. The homeostatic function of the kidney generates substantial differences in tissue environment between different anatomical regions of the kidney. Complementing efforts in generating single-cell molecular profiles across the entire cross-section of the adult human kidney, from outer cortex to upper ureter, we aim to also interrogate whether the epigenome of kidney-resident immune cells varies across different anatomical regions of the kidney. The expression of RNA transcripts is, in part, controlled by the state of chromatin, with closed structures sterically hindering the binding of transcriptional modulators. The chromatin landscape of immune cells can change according to environmental stimuli, for example, via engagement of toll-like receptor (TLR)4 with lipopolysaccharide. Here we wish to determine whether and how the environmental differences in cortex, medulla and pelvis might impact resident immune cell epigenome using single-cell ATAC-seq on the 10x platform.

The majority of T-ALL cases harbor activating mutations in NOTCH1 together with mutations in genes implicated in kinase signaling, transcriptional regulation or protein translation. To obtain more insight in the level of clonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and during treatment, we used single-cell targeted DNA sequencing with the Tapestri platform. We designed a custom ALL panel and obtained accurate single-nucleotide variant and small insertion-deletion mutation calling for 305 amplicons covering 110 genes in about 4400 cells per sample and time point. A total of 108,188 cells were analyzed for 25 samples of 8 T-ALL patients. We typically observed a major clone at diagnosis (&gt;35% of the cells) accompanied by several minor clones of which some were less than 1% of the total number of cells. Four patients had &gt;2 NOTCH1 mutations some of which present in minor clones, indicating a strong pressure to acquire NOTCH1 mutations in developing T-ALL cells. By analyzing longitudinal samples, we detected the presence and clonal nature of residual leukemic cells as well as clones with a minor presence at diagnosis that evolved to clinically relevant major clones at later disease stages. Single-cell DNA amplicon sequencing is a sensitive assay to detect clonal architecture and evolution in T-ALL."
EGAS00001004637,paediatric  adult nasal scrnaseq covid19,"Transcriptomic profiling of patient matched normal and CIS samples at the single-cell level.

Lung cancer kills more men and women than any other cancer. Smoking rates are decreasing, however given the rising trend of smoking in the Far East, India and Africa, this is unlikely to change. We remain convinced that to improve lung cancer survival we must detect or intervene early. The most common subtype of lung cancer in the UK is lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), constituting 43% of lung cancer in England and Wales. LUSC develops through a progression from normal epithelium to low-grade lesions and then to carcinoma in situ (CIS, high-grade lesions), before progressing to invasive cancer.
Cancers are thought to develop from an area of epithelium equally exposed to toxins producing a ‘field of injury’. Our data demonstrates that the traditional understanding of ‘field of injury’ is flawed. We show that the airway as a whole can reverse genetic damage either through clonal expansion of less mutated cells or deletion of more mutated cells. To further define the ‘field of injury’ model in diseased airway we aim to analyse the transcriptional landscape of patient matched normal and CIS samples at the single-cell level. This will allow us to delineate specific cell subtype changes and key gene regulatory networks that will assist in our understanding of the progression of LUSC. Our findings could also develop a successful biomarker-driven early detection lung cancer programme.

EGAS00001003932,polymorphisms   mitochondrial genome  associated  bullous pemphigoid  germans,"Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most prevalent autoimmune skin blistering disease and is characterized by the generation of autoantibodies against the hemidesmosomal proteins BP180 (type XVII collagen) and BP230. Most intriguingly, BP is distinct from other autoimmune diseases because it predominantly affects elderly individuals above the age of 75 years, raising the question why autoantibodies and the clinical lesions of BP emerges mostly in this later stage of life, even in individuals harboring known putative BP-associated germline gene variants. The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) is a potential candidate to provide additional insights into the BP etiology; however, the mtDNA has not been extensively explored to date. Therefore, we sequenced the whole mtDNA of German BP patients (n=180) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n=188) using next generation sequencing (NGS) technology, followed by the replication study using Sanger sequencing of an additional independent BP (n=89) and control cohort (n=104). While the BP and control groups showed comparable mitochondrial haplogroup distributions, the haplogroup T exhibited a tendency of higher frequency
in BP patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases (ND) compared to BP patients without ND (p= 0.1448, Fisher’s exact test). A total of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the mtDNA, namely, m.16263T&gt;C, m.11914G&gt;A, m.16051A&gt;G, and m.16162A&gt;G, were found to be significantly associated with BP based on the meta-analysis of our NGS data and the Sanger sequencing data (p=0.0017, p=0.0132, p=0.0129, and p=0.0076, respectively, Peto’s test). In summary, our study is the first to interrogate the whole mtDNA in BP patients and controls and to implicate multiple novel mtDNA variants in disease susceptibility.

While  genomic classification of pediatric B-lineage ALL (B-ALL) has led to improved risk assignment and therapeutic paradigms, similar advances in adults have been lacking. The international UKALLXII/E2993 (NCT00002514) trial accrued over 2000 adult (17-64 years old) patients over 13 years, including 1229 BCR/ABL negative B-ALLs. While 93% of B-ALL achieved a remission, 41% relapsed at a median time of 13 months (Range) and overall survival (OS) at 5 years was 42% (CI). Older age and higher white blood cell (WBC) count at presentation negatively affected OS. Patients with a sibling donor assigned to allogeneic transplantation had superior OS compared to patients without donor. Randomization of patients without a donor showed an advantage of chemotherapy over autologous transplantation in first remission. Transcriptome sequencing of 94% of E2993 patients enabled genomic subtyping. We found that one-third of patients belonged to favorable genotypes (DUX4-rearranged, ETV6-RUNX1, TCF3-PBX1, PAX5 P80R, high hyperdiploidy). Of 63.4% of patients classified as high-risk based age and WBC count at diagnosis, almost 40% harbored subtype-defining genetic associations associated with favorable- or intermediate outcomes. These patients did significantly better than expected from their protocol-defined risk assignment. Our data in a large adult B-ALL cohort treated on a single international trial show the important prognostic value of genomic analysis and the potential benefit for many of the novel genotypes."

Array-CGH and expression analyses of 1172 primary breast tumours revealed that ZNF703 was the single gene within the minimal amplicon and was amplified predominantly in the Luminal B subtype. Amplification was shown to correlate with increased gene and protein expression and was associated with a distinct expression signature and poor clinical outcome. ZNF703 transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, behaving as a classical oncogene, and regulated proliferation in human luminal breast cancer cell lines and immortalized human mammary epithelial cells. Manipulation of ZNF703 expression in the luminal MCF7 cell line modified the effects of TGFÎ² on proliferation. Overexpression of ZNF703 in normal human breast epithelial cells enhanced the frequency of in vitro colony-forming cells from luminal progenitors.

We explored the relationship between genetic variants influencing predisposition to type 2 diabetes (T2D) and related glycemic traits, and human pancreatic islet transcription using RNA-Seq and genotyping data from 420 islet donors. We find: (a) eQTLs have a variable replication rate across the 44 GTEx  tissues (&amp;lt;73%), indicating that our study captured islet-specific cis-eQTL signals; (b) islet eQTL signals show marked overlap with islet epigenome annotation, though eQTL effect size is reduced in the stretch enhancers most strongly implicated in GWAS signal location; (c) selective enrichment of islet eQTL overlap with the subset of T2D variants implicated in islet dysfunction; and (d) colocalization between islet eQTLs and variants influencing T2D or related glycemic traits, delivering candidate effector transcripts at 23 loci, including DGKB and TCF7L2.

Little is known on the molecular basis underlying the biological and clinical behavior of this cancer. Here, using multi-omics data, we demonstrate the existence of two retinoblastoma subtypes. Subtype 1, of earlier onset, includes most of the heritable forms. It harbors few genetic alterations other than the initiating RB1 inactivation and corresponds to differentiated tumors expressing mature cone markers. By contrast, subtype 2 tumors harbor frequent recurrent genetic alterations including MYCN-amplification. They express markers of less differentiated cone together with neuronal/ganglion cell markers with marked inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity. The cone dedifferentiation in subtype 2 is associated with stemness features including low immune and interferon response, E2F and MYC/MYCN activation and a higher propensity for metastasis. The recognition of these two subtypes, one maintaining a cone-differentiated state, and the other, more aggressive, associated with cone dedifferentiation and expression of neuronal markers, opens up important biological and clinical perspectives for retinoblastomas.
In this study, we performed targeted sequencing of the exonic regions of RB1, BCOR and ARID1A on 37 samples from the series of 102 retinoblastomas.

However, accurate, affordable, and fast identification of such SV biomarkers is challenging, which hinders routine use in the clinic. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach - termed SHARC - for rapid discovery of somatic SV breakpoints as personalized tumour biomarkers. SHARC combines low-coverage cancer genome sketching by using Oxford Nanopore portable sequencing with a random forest classification and a dedicated filtering pipeline to enrich for somatic SVs. Our method leverages the real-time and long-read capabilities of Nanopore sequencing to identify somatic SV breakpoints at nucleotide resolution from a tumour biopsy within two days. We applied SHARC to tumour samples of high-grade ovarian and prostate cancer and validated on average 10 somatic SVs per sample with the use of PCR mini-amplicons. Finally, we demonstrate that these somatic SV biomarkers can  be used to detect tumour presence from liquid biopsies in a quantitative manner and we retrospectively monitored treatment response in patients with prostate cancer, demonstrating its potential benefit for clinical practice."

We performed multi-omic analysis including whole-exome, RNA and miRNA sequencing and quantification of 126 proteins in a series 34 LCCL coupled with a screening of 29 anti-cancer agents. Molecular profiles of LCCL and primary HCC were compared and we searched for molecular features associated with drug response. Our panel of LCCL faithfully recapitulated the most aggressive molecular ""proliferation class"" of HCC. Genomic alterations of the RAS-MAPK pathway correlated with trametinib sensitivity that was more potent than FGFR4 inhibitors in tumor cells depending on the FGF19/FGFR4 pathway. Moreover, we showed that FGF19 amplification was only functional in tumor cells that retained a hepatocyte differentiation program with expression of FGFR4, KLB and NR1H4 highlighting the complex interplay between the genomic and transcriptomic context in drug response. We also identified drugs/combination that could target efficiently the transcriptomic ""progenitor subclass of HCC"", as well as specific genetic contexts such as inactivating mutations in TSC1/TSC2 and TP53 associated with higher sensitivity to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and the AURKA inhibitor alisertib, respectively.

The genetic determinants of the Lp(a) lipoprotein level and their relevance for the risk of coronary disease are incompletely understood. METHODS: We used a novel gene chip containing 48,742 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2100 candidate genes to test for associations in 3145 case subjects with coronary disease and 3352 control subjects. Replication was tested in three independent populations involving 4846 additional case subjects with coronary disease and 4594 control subjects. RESULTS: Three chromosomal regions (6q26-27, 9p21, and 1p13) were strongly associated with the risk of coronary disease. The LPA locus on 6q26-27 encoding Lp(a) lipoprotein had the strongest association. We identified a common variant (rs10455872) at the LPA locus with an odds ratio for coronary disease of 1.70 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49 to 1.95) and another independent variant (rs3798220) with an odds ratio of 1.92 (95% CI, 1.48 to 2.49). Both variants were strongly associated with an increased level of Lp(a) lipoprotein, a reduced copy number in LPA (which determines the number of kringle IV-type 2 repeats), and a small Lp(a) lipoprotein size. Replication studies confirmed the effects of both variants on the Lp(a) lipoprotein level and the risk of coronary disease. A meta-analysis showed that with a genotype score involving both LPA SNPs, the odds ratios for coronary disease were 1.51 (95% CI, 1.38 to 1.66) for one variant and 2.57 (95% CI, 1.80 to 3.67) for two or more variants. After adjustment for the Lp(a) lipoprotein level, the association between the LPA genotype score and the risk of coronary disease was abolished. CONCLUSIONS: We identified two LPA variants that were strongly associated with both an increased level of Lp(a) lipoprotein and an increased risk of coronary disease. Our findings provide support for a causal role of Lp(a) lipoprotein in coronary disease.

Finally, we reported 4 novel non-coding variants which cause disease through thedisruption of transcription of ARPC1B, GATA1, LRBA and MPL. Our study demonstrates asynergy by using WGS for diagnosis and aetiological discovery in routine healthcare."

In this study, we comprehensively delineated the genomic basis of BL through whole genome sequencing of 101 tumors representing all 3 subtypes of BL to identify 72 driver genes. These data were additionally informed by CRISPR screens in BL cell lines to functionally annotate the role of oncogenic drivers. Nearly every driver gene was found to have both coding and non-coding mutations highlighting the importance of whole genome sequencing for identifying driver events. Our data implicate coding and non-coding mutations in IGLL5, BACH2, SIN3A and DNMT1. EBV infection was associated with higher mutation load, with EBV type 1 showing a higher mutational burdens than type 2 EBV. While sporadic and immunodeficiency-associated BLs had similar genetic profiles, endemic BLs manifested more frequent mutations in BCL7A and BCL6, and fewer genetic alterations in DNMT1, SNTB2, CTCF. Silencing mutations in ID3 were a common feature of all three subtypes of BL. In vitro, mass spectrometry-based proteomics demonstrated that the ID3 protein binds primarily to TCF3 and TCF4. In vivo knockout of ID3 potentiated the effects of MYC, leading to rapid tumorigenesis and tumor phenotypes consistent with those observed in the human disease."
EGAS00001001709,histological transformation  progression  follicular lymphoma  clonal evolution study,"Background: Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent, yet incurable B-cell malignancy. A subset of patients experience increased mortality rate driven by two distinct clinical end points: histological transformation and early progression after immuno-chemotherapy. The nature of tumor clonal dynamics leading to these clinical endpoints is poorly understood and previously determined genetic alterations do not explain the majority of transformed cases or accurately predict early progressive disease. We contend that detailed knowledge of the expansion patterns of specific cell populations plus their associated mutations would provide insight into therapeutic strategies and disease biology over the timecourse of FL clinical histories.

Methods and Findings: Using a combination of whole genome sequencing, targeted deep sequencing and digital droplet PCR on matched diagnostic and relapse specimens, we deciphered the constituent clonal populations in n=15 transformation patients and n=6 progressors, and measured their change in abundance over time. We observed widely divergent patterns of clonal dynamics in transformed cases relative to progressed cases. Transformation specimens were generally composed of clones that were rare or absent in diagnostic specimens, consistent with dramatic clonal expansions that came to dominate the transformation specimen. This pattern was independent of time to transformation and treatment modality. By contrast, progression specimens were composed of clones that were already present in the diagnostic specimens and exhibited only moderate clonal dynamics, even in the presence of immuno-chemotherapy. Analysis of somatic mutations impacting 94 genes was undertaken in a validation cohort consisting of 395 samples from 277 patients in order to decipher disrupted biology in the two clinical endpoints. We found 12 genes were more commonly mutated in transformed samples than in preceding FL, including TP53, B2M, CCND3, GNA13, S1PR2 and P2RY8. Moreover, 10 genes were more commonly mutated in diagnostic specimens of early progressors including TP53, BTG1, MKI67 and XBP1.

Conclusions: Our results illuminate contrasting modes of evolution shaping the clinical histories of transformation and progression. They have implication for interpretation of evolutionary dynamics in the context of treatment-induced selective pressures, and indicate that transformation and progression will require different clinical management strategies."

However, all reported cases are of deidentified individuals without full medical and genomic data available in the public domain.

Patient and Methods: We present a case of whole genome tumor and germline sequencing in a patient with advanced prostate cancer, who has agreed to make his genomic and clinical data publicly available in an accompanying personal testimonial.

Results: We describe an 84-year-old Caucasian male with a Gleason 10 oligometastastic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Whole-genome sequencing provided insights into his tumor’s underlying mutational processes and the development of an SPOP mutation. It also revealed an androgen-receptor dependency of his cancer which was reflected in his durable response to radiation and hormonal therapy. Potentially actionable genomic lesions in the tumor were identified through a personalized medicine approach for potential future therapy, but at the moment, he remains in remission, illustrating the hormonal sensitivity of his SPOP-driven prostate cancer. We also placed this patient in the context of a large prostate-cancer cohort from the PCAWG (Pan-cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes) group. In this comparison, the patient's cancer appears typical in terms of the number and type of somatic mutations, but it has a somewhat larger contribution from the mutational process associated with aging.

Conclusion: We combined the expertise of medical oncology and genomics approaches to develop a molecular tumor board to integrate the care and study of this patient, who continues to have an outstanding response to his combined modality treatment. This identifiable case potentially helps overcome barriers to clinical and genomic data sharing."

To identify novel opportunities for management of recurrent pancreatic cancer we performed whole exome or targeted sequencing of 10 resected primary cancers and their matched intrapancreatic recurrences or distant metastases. We identified that recurrent disease develops from a monophyletic or polyphyletic origin, and this distinction has potential clinical relevance.  In all patients, treatment induced genetic bottlenecks led to a modified genetic landscape and subclonal heterogeneity for driver gene alterations in part due to intermetastatic seeding.  In one patient what was believed to be recurrent disease was an independent (second) primary tumor. These findings strongly advocate for routine post-treatment sampling in the management of recurrent pancreatic cancer."

We performed whole exome sequencing andGeneseeqPrime (425 genes) panel sequencing of the primary tumor, plasma and matched whiteblood cell samples from 20 PTCs with DM and 46 PTCs without DM. We identified somaticmutations, gene fusions and copy number alterations and analyzed their relationships with DM ofPTCs. BRAF-V600E was identified in 73% of PTCs, followed by RET fusions (14%) in a mutuallyexclusive manner (p&lt;0.0001). We found gene fusions (RET, ALK or NTRK1) (p&lt;0.01) andchromosome 22q loss(p&lt;0.01) were independently associated with DM by both univariate andmultivariate analysis. A nomogram model consisting of chromosome 22q loss, gene fusions andthree clinical variables was built for predicting DM in PTC (C-index=0.89).The plasma circulatingtumor DNA (ctDNA) detection rate in PTCs was only 38.9%, however, it was significantlyassociated with the metastatic status (p= 0.04), tumor size (p= 0.001) and invasiveness (p= 0.01).In conclusion, gene fusions and chromosome 22q loss were independently associated with DM inPTCs and could serve as molecular biomarkers for predicting DM.

We have studied a unique case of astroblastoma arising in a 6 year old girl, with multiple recurrences over a period of 10 years, with the pathognomonic MN1:BEND2 fusion. Exome sequencing allowed for a phylogenetic reconstruction of tumour evolution, which when integrated with clinical, pathological and radiological data provide for a thorough understanding of disease progression, with initial treatment driving tumour dissemination along four distinct trajectories.

Notably, solid tumors often harbor multiple genetic alterations, complicating the development of effective treatments. To address such challenges, we established a comprehensive dataset of molecularly annotated patient derivatives coupled with pharmacological profiles for 60 targeted agents to explore dynamic pharmacogenomic interactions in gastric cancers. We identified lineage-specific drug sensitivities based on histopathological and molecular subclassification, including substantial sensitivities toward VEGFR and EGFR inhibition therapies in diffuse- and signet ring-type gastric tumors, respectively. We identified potential therapeutic opportunities for WNT pathway inhibitors in ALK-mutant tumors, a significant association between PIK3CA-E542K mutation and AZD5363 response, and transcriptome expression of RNF11 as a potential predictor of response to gefitinib.

Non-invasive approaches for assessment of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) provide an opportunity for detection and intervention that may have broader accessibility than current imaging approaches.  Using a machine learning model for detecting tumor-derived cfDNA through genome-wide analyses of cfDNA fragmentation, we examined a prospective study of 365 individuals at risk for lung cancer (Lung Cancer Diagnostic Study, LUCAS), including 129 individuals ultimately diagnosed with lung cancer and 236 individuals determined to not have lung cancer.  We externally validated the cancer detection model using an independent cohort of 385 non-cancer individuals and 46 predominantly early stage lung cancer patients.  Combining fragmentation features with clinical risk factors and CEA levels followed by CT imaging detected 94% of patients with cancer across stages and subtypes, including 91% of stage I/II and 96% of stage III/IV, at 80% specificity.  Genome-wide fragmentation profiles across ~13,000 ASCL1 transcription factor binding sites could be used to distinguish individuals with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) from those with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with high accuracy (AUC=0.98).  Among individuals with lung cancer, a higher cfDNA fragmentation score was associated with tumor size and invasion, and represented an independent prognostic indicator of survival.

However, other KRAS-hotspot-mutations exist in MM patients, including the less common exon4-mutations. Within the current study, the coding regions of KRAS in 80 MM patients at diagnosis, uniformly treated with bortezomib and high-dose chemotherapy, were deep-sequenced. Moreover, the functional impact of KRASG12A as well as the two exon4-mutations A146T (AMO1) and A146V (MM patient) on different survival pathways was investigated. Specifically, an siRNA-mediated knockdown in AMO1 was performed and KRASWT, KRASG12A, KRAS146T and KRAS146V were overexpressed in the KRASWT cell lines JJN3 and OPM2 using lentiviral transduction and the transposase based Sleeping Beauty system. KRAS-mutations were not associated with survival. Yet, the expression of all KRAS-mutants had an impact on MEK/ERK-signaling in two independent MM cell lines and on AKT/PI3K-signaling in one MM cell line."

Lenalidomide (LEN) is the treatment of choice for patients with del(5q) MDS, but half of the responding patients become resistant within two years. TP53 mutations are detected in ~20% of patients who become resistant to LEN. Our data show that patients who become resistant to LEN harbor either TP53 or RUNX1 mutations or loss of RUNX1 expression. Here we show that LEN-induced degradation of IKZF1 permits a RUNX1/GATA2 complex to drive megakaryocytic differentiation and consequent del(5q) MDS progenitor cell death via CRBN-mediated CSNK1A1 degradation. Overexpression of GATA2 is able to restore LEN sensitivity in the context of RUNX1 or TP53 mutations by enhancing LEN-induced megakaryocytic differentiation. Screening for TP53 and RUNX1 mutations or downregulation should identify patients resistant to LEN, and strategies to activate GATA2 may resensitize del(5q) MDS cells to LEN"
EGAS00001005424,chromothripsis   circular recombination drives oncogene amplification  human cancer,"The mechanisms behind the evolution of complex genomic amplifications in cancer have remained largely unclear. We here identified a type of amplification, termed as “seismic amplification”, that is characterized by multiple rearrangements and discontinuous copy number levels. Seismic amplifications occurred in 9.9% (274/2,756) of cases across 38 cancer types and were associated with massively increased copy numbers and elevated oncogene expression. Reconstruction of the development of seismic amplification revealed a stepwise evolution, starting with a chromothripsis event, followed by formation of circular extrachromosomal DNA that subsequently underwent repetitive rounds of circular recombination. The resulting amplicons persisted as extrachromosomal DNA circles or had reintegrated into the genome in overt tumors. Together, our data indicate that the sequential occurrence of chromothripsis and circular recombination drives oncogene amplification and over-expression in a substantial fraction of human malignancies."

Here we provide a catalogue of variants called after sequencing the exomes of 45 babies from the State of Rio Grande do Nord in Brazil.

A total of 612,761 variants were identified in at least one individual in this Brazilian Cohort, including 559,448 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 53,313 insertion/deletions.  Of these, 58,111 overlapped with nonsynonymous (nsSNVs) or splice site (ssSNVs) SNVs in dbNSFP.  As an aid to clinical diagnosis of rare diseases, we used the American College of Medicine Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines to assign pathogenic/likely pathogenic status to 439 (0.755%) of the 58,111 nsSNVs and ssSNVs.

We apply this approach to analyze samples from patients in the CRITICS trial, a phase III randomized controlled study of perioperative chemotherapy in patients with operable gastric cancer.  After filtering alterations derived from matched white-blood cells, the presence of ctDNA predicts recurrence when analyzed within nine weeks after preoperative treatment and after surgery in patients eligible for multimodal treatment.

Whole-genome sequencing studies have not yet identified highly recurrent driver non-coding SNVs (ncSNVs) or genomic rearrangements (Grs). As a result, the underlying events that drive this frequent disease remain unknown. While mitochondrial mutations have been linked to several tumour types, including prostate cancer, their global frequency and impact has remained unknown. To determine if mitochondrial mutations might drive some prostate cancers, we analyzed the mitochondrial genomes of 216 tumours from patients with the most commonly diagnosed form of prostate cancer. We developed a pipeline that conservatively identified only mitochondrial SNVs (mitoSNVs) that differed in the heteroplasmy fraction as compared to their paired-normal by at least 20%. We identified several features of the mitochondrial genome that were correlated with nuclear genomic mutations, as well as features that were significantly associated with biochemical recurrence."

We currently lack robust methods to determine how pre-existing and adaptive features affect cellular responses to therapies. Here, by conducting clonal fitness mapping and transcriptional characterization using expressed barcodes and single-cell RNA-sequencing, we have developed TraCe-seq, a method that captures at clonal resolution the origin, fate, and differential early adaptive transcriptional programs of cells in a complex population in response to distinct treatments. We used TraCe-seq to benchmark how next-generation dual EGFR inhibitors-degraders compare to standard EGFR kinase inhibitors in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells.
To QC the TraCe-seq strategy, single-cell RNA-seq libraries were generated from a variety of human cancer cell lines transduced with the TraCe-seq library to validate the TraCe-seq strategy. Specifically, 5 different cell lines (PC9, MCF-10A, MDA-MB-231, NCI-H358, and NCI-H1373) were each transduced with a unique TraCe-seq barcode. The transduced cells were selected with puromycin only, dissociated to single cell suspensions, and then mixed together. The complex mixture of the 5 cell lines was profiled by 10X scRNA-seq. Furthermore, transduced NCI-H1373 cells were sorted by FACS to enrich for the top 50% of eGFP positive cells, and sorted cells were cultured briefly and used to construct scRNA-seq libraries and profiled by 10x scRNA-seq.
To carry out the full TraCe-seq experiment, ~600 PC9 cells carrying unique TraCe-seq barcodes were expanded over 12 doublings to establish the barcoded population. A subset of the barcoded PC9 population was used to generate scRNA-seq libraries and profiled by 10x scRNA-seq prior to treatment to establish a baseline transcription profile for each barcoded clone. The rest of the cells were then treated for four days with 1 µM erlotinib, 1 µM GNE-069, or 1 µM GNE-104 respectively. scRNA-seq libraries were then generated form the treated cells and profiled by 10x scRNA-seq."

Yet, they require additional mechanisms to arrest those cancer cells that are not rejected. Cytokine-induced senescence (CIS) can stably arrest cancer cells, suggesting that interferon-dependent induction of senescence-inducing cell cycle regulators is needed to control those cancer cells that escape from killing. Here we report in two different cancers sensitive to T cell-mediated rejection, we show that deletion of the senescence-inducing cell cycle regulators p16Ink4a/p19Arf (Cdkn2a) or p21Cip1 (Cdkn1a)  in the tumour cells abrogated both, the natural and the ICB-induced cancer immune control. Also in humans, melanoma metastases that progressed rapidly during ICB have losses of senescence-inducing genes and amplifications of senescence inhibitors. Metastatic cells also resist CIS. Such genetic and functional alterations are infrequent in metastatic melanomas regressing during ICB. Thus, activation of tumour-intrinsic, senescence-inducing cell cycle regulators is required to stably arrest those cancer cells that escape from eradication."

We generated a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) model genome engineered to express ETV6-RUNX1 from the endogenous ETV6 promoter. In vitro B cell differentiation of hPSCs recapitulated human fetal B lymphopoiesis at the global transcriptional level. Furthermore, hPSC-derived IL7R+ early lymphoid progenitors show a switch from myeloid to lymphoid lineage priming during culture, recapitulating a transition that we also observed in first trimester fetal liver. ETV6-RUNX1 impairs B lineage commitment from hPSC IL7R+ lymphoid progenitors and ETV6-RUNX1+ proB cells aberrantly co-express B and myeloid genes and retain myeloid potential.

To date, molecular mechanisms underlying the co-existence of HCC and iCCA components in a single tumor remain elusive. Here we show that H-ChC samples contain substantial private mutations from WES analyses, ranging from 33.1% to 86.4%, indicative of substantive intratumor heterogeneity (ITH). However, on the other hand, numerous ubiquitous mutations shared by HCC and iCCA suggest the monoclonal origin of H-ChC. Mutated genes identify herein e.g. VCAN, ACVR2A and FCGBP are speculated to contribute to distinct differentiation of HCC and iCCA within H-ChC. Moreover, immunohistochemistry demonstrate that EpCAM is highly expressed in 80% of H-ChC implying the stemness of such liver cancer. In summary, our data highlight the monoclonal origin and stemness of H-ChC, as well as substantial intratumoral heterogeneity."

After inferring evolutionary relationships, we found that the ancestral cell had initiated and clonally expanded to form one or more lesions, and that subsequent driver gene mutations eventually led to a pancreatic cancer. We also found that this multi-step progression generally spans many years. Our data suggest that independent, high-grade pancreatic lesions observed in a histologic cross section often represent a single neoplasm that can spread and colonize the ductal system, accumulating spatial and genetic divergence over time."

The term Chromotripsis is used for single-step shattering events that give rise to intermittent single gains and losses as well as high level amplifications (Nature Reviews Cancer 12, 663-670 (October 2012). In 2 % (8/420) of metastatic colorectal cancers (mCRCs)(ref to haan &amp; Mekenkamp) we observed clusters of multiple (N=3-30) high-level amplifications with sharp boundaries, intermitted by a constant non-amplified copy number level, in an otherwise common copy number background. We observed this phenomenon in various malignancies, with up to 100 (Daoud?) high level clustered amplifications, that are particularly common in higher grade tumors (Pieter&amp;Daphne&amp;other pathologists help wording, GBMs, dedifferentiated liposarcomas, pediatric MYCN, tumors with lower overall survival)) and introduced the term chromekrexis (“chrom” for chromosome and “ekrexis” Greek for eruption). We observe that amplifications within a Chromekrexis region are not necessarily all of the same amplitude, and physically attached to each other in a complex web of rearrangements indicative of double minute formation (Nick’s section). We provide evidence for Chromekrexis as a late onset event, of aggressive tumor behavior that significantly correlates with a worse overall survival. Given the distinct pattern of complex genomic rearrangements, and the absence of the characteristic intermittent single copy number gains and losses of chromothripsis, chromekrexis should be recognized as an independent chromoanagenesis mechnism that can confer detrimental growth advantages across tumor types."

In this study we use an integrative approach combining the analysis of human data and mechanistic studies in model systems to identify a circulating 3-microRNA signature that reflect key processes linked to neural homeostasis and informs about cognitive status.

In this subtype of AML, the translocation of a GATA2 enhancer (3q21) to MECOM (3q26) results in overexpression of the MECOM isoform EVI1 and monoallelic expression of GATA2 from the unaffected allele. The full-length MECOM transcript, MDS1-EVI1, is not expressed as the result of the 3q26 rearrangement. Besides the classical inv(3)/t(3;3), a number of other 3q26/MECOM rearrangements with poor treatment response have been reported in AML. Here we demonstrate, in a group of 33 AML patients with atypical 3q26 rearrangements, MECOM involvement with EVI1 overexpression, but no or low MDS1-EVI1 levels. Moreover, the 3q26 translocations in these AML patients often involve super-enhancers of genes active in myeloid development (e.g. CD164, PROM1, CDK6 or MYC). In more than 50% of these cases allele specific GATA2 expression was observed, either by copy number loss or by an unexplained allelic imbalance. Altogether, atypical 3q26 recapitulate the main leukemic mechanism of inv(3)/t(3;3) AML, namely EVI1 overexpression driven by enhancer hijacking, absent MDS1-EVI1 expression and potential GATA2 involvement. Therefore, we conclude that both atypical 3q26/MECOM and inv(3)/t(3;3) can be classified as a single entity of 3q26-rearranged AMLs. Routine analyses determining MECOM rearrangements, EVI1 and MDS1-EVI1 expression are required to recognize 3q-rearranged AML cases."

In addition, high prevalence of cardiac failure and abnormal renal function in COVID19 patients implicates heart and kidney involvement, but the pathogenesis of organ specific damage - whether via a direct cytopathic mechanism or an indirect inflammatory response - remains unknown . Currently, we lack confirmation of target cell types and cellular processes in infected tissues as autopsies are discouraged in most countries due to health and safety risks.

Here, we propose to identify infected cell types and aberrant molecular pathologies in this precious tissue resource using single cell and spatial genomics. We will prioritise three organ systems: the human airway, heart and the kidney. We will directly examine the cellular identities of SARS-CoV-2 infected cell types and identify the cellular responses to infection across these organs.

Here, we report on establishment of long-term human-derived organoid cultures from both healthy ecto- and endocervical epithelia that closely recapitulate the tissues of origin by maintaining the authentic histological and tissue-specific gene expression profiles. Additionally, using material from patients’ Pap-brush material, a successful panel of long-term patient-derived cancer organoids was established that maintain the causative viral infection in vitro and show differential response to common chemotherapy regimens. This study provides a promising platform for cervical cancer research and studying direct virus-host interactions."

In order to understand the clonal relationships between the four tumor instances and the origin of metastasis, we performed whole genome sequencing of the intracranial tumors and the tumor located in the right iliac bone. Mutational and copy number profile comparisons of the metastatic to intracranial tumors highlighted a high similarity in molecular profile, but contrasting evidence regarding the origin of the metastasis. Subclonal reconstruction suggested a parallel evolution of the recurrent tumors, and that the metastatic tumor was largely derived from the first recurrence. We conclude that metastasis in glioma can be a late event in tumorigenesis."

PAH is a rare disease characterized by an abnormal rise in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (&gt; or equal to 25 mmHg at rest), which, in turn, leads to a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and ultimately to death, due to right ventricular failure. Heritable PAH has an overall prevalence below 1 case per million adults and is defined by either the presence of a known genetic defect linked to the disease or a positive family history. Heritable PAH is inherited as an autosomal dominant disease. However, not all BMPR2 mutation carriers develop the disease, highlighting the presence of reduced penetrance. In this family, there are 22 mutation carriers from which 8 were diagnosed with heritable PAH and the other 14 were healthy at the time of examination."

High frequencies of mutation were detected in CTNNB1(43%), PIK3CA(43%), ARID1A(36%), PTEN(29%), TP53(26%) and SOX8(19%), a novel target of recurrent mutation in EnOC. POLE and mismatch repair protein-encoding genes were mutated at lower frequency (6%, 18%) with significant co-occurrence. A molecular taxonomy was constructed using a novel algorithm (PRISTINE), identifying clinically distinct EnOC subtypes: TP53m cases demonstrated greater genomic complexity, were frequently FIGO stage III/IV at diagnosis (48%) and incompletely debulked (44%), and demonstrated inferior survival; conversely, CTNNB1m cases demonstrated low complexity and excellent clinical outcome, were predominantly stage I/II at diagnosis (89%) and completely resected (87%). Tumour complexity provides further resolution within the TP53wt/CTNNB1wt group. Moreover, we identify the WNT, MAPK/RAS and PI3K pathways as good candidate targets for molecular therapeutics in EnOC."

We found no significant differences in somatic mutations or focal copy number alterations between early-stage and late-stage cohorts. There was, however, a significant difference in both ploidy and copy number signature exposure between early and late-stage samples, with higher ploidy and signature 4 exposure in late-stage cases. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed three clusters, which were prognostic. Together, our data suggest that early and late-stage HGSC share fundamental genomic features, but that late- stage disease appears distinct from early-stage, with evidence of whole genome duplication that may provide evolutionary benefit."

To address this problem, we conducted a multi-centre genome-wide association study (GWAS) of life-threatening Plasmodium falciparum infection (severe malaria) in over 11,000 African children, with replication data in a further 14,000 individuals. Here we report a novel malaria resistance locus close to a cluster of genes encoding glycophorins that are receptors for erythrocyte invasion by P. falciparum. We identify a haplotype at this locus that provides 33% protection against severe malaria (odds ratio = 0.67, 95% confidence interval = 0.60–0.76, P value = 9.5 × 10−11) and is linked to polymorphisms that have previously been shown to have features of ancient balancing selection, on the basis of haplotype sharing between humans and chimpanzees4. Taken together with previous observations on the malaria-protective role of blood group O, these data reveal that two of the strongest GWAS signals for severe malaria lie in or close to genes encoding the glycosylated surface coat of the erythrocyte cell membrane, both within regions of the genome where it appears that evolution has maintained diversity for millions of years. These findings provide new insights into the host–parasite interactions that are critical in determining the outcome of malaria infection."

We aim to directly identify the human cell types infected by SARS-CoV-2 and measure the cellular response to COVID19 infection across 20 different tissues from infected patient autopsies. We have examined the expression pattern of viral entry receptors across healthy human tissues to predict  several candidate target cell types across the airway and heart. In addition, high prevalence of cardiac failure and abnormal renal function in COVID19 patients implicates heart and kidney involvement, but the pathogenesis of organ specific damage - whether via a direct cytopathic mechanism or an indirect inflammatory response - remains unknown . Currently, we lack confirmation of target cell types and cellular processes in infected tissues as autopsies are discouraged in most countries due to health and safety risks. Our collaborators Drs Michael Osborn and Brian Hanley (Imperial College) have outlined guidelines to perform post-mortem in COVID19 patients (Hanley et al., 2020) and have established a programme of autopsies for research to be performed in a high-risk facility at Westminster Public Mortuary. Here, we propose to identify infected cell types and aberrant molecular pathologies in this precious tissue resource using single cell and spatial genomics. We will prioritise three organ systems: the human airway, heart and the kidney. We will directly examine the cellular identities of SARS-CoV-2 infected cell types and identify the cellular responses to infection across these organs. This fundamental knowledge will help guide future treatment choices for COVID19.

EGAS00001000949,clinical  molecular investigation  familial cebpa mutated acute myeloid leukaemia,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are clonal diseases arising from the sequential acquisition of genetic aberrations in haematopoietic stem cells.  Whilst the aetiology is predominantly sporadic, rare reports describe the autosomal dominant inheritance of MDS and AML (familial MDS/AML), often presenting in younger patients (&lt;40 years of age) with a germline mutation in one of three haematopoietic transcription factors: RUNX1, CEBPA and GATA2. The clinical recognition of familial disease can be challenging due to wide variations in phenotype, latency and transmission, complicated further by the patients’ awareness and reporting of affected relatives. Distinct clinical manifestations have however been reported for each genetic subtype and whilst RUNX1 and GATA2 mutations can harbour prolonged dysplastic or cytopenic phases, germline CEBPA mutations universally present with AML de novo. Our group were the first to describe germline CEBPA mutations in 3 related individuals, all of whom developed AML between 10-30 years of age.  The initial pedigree together with those described in the intervening period, were predominantly isolated case reports with limited follow up, hence long term outcomes for this group of patients remain poorly defined. This contrasts with CEBPA mutations occurring in 10-15% of sporadic AML with normal karytoype (NK-AML), where double mutations (CEBPAdm, found in approximately 50% of all CEBPA-AML) are considered a unique molecular entity, associated with favourable clinical outcomes.  In sporadic and familial CEBPAdm AML, N’ terminal mutations enforce translation of the shorter P30-kDa isoform and are typically accompanied by C’ terminal insertions or deletions (disrupting the DNA-binding and/or Leucine zipper domains). Definition of the full molecular landscape awaits extensive whole exome sequencing, although GATA2 mutations (targeting the Zinc Finger 1, ZF1, domain) have been reported in 20-40% of sporadic CEBPAdm AML and recent targeted resequencing analysis revealed a further association with WT1 mutations.  With minimal clinical and molecular information available for familial CEBPA-AML, we are often consulted regarding the management of this unique patient population. To address this need, we have investigated a multi-centre cohort of families with germline CEBPA mutations, providing extended clinical follow up, whole exome profiling of secondary mutations and molecular analysis of relapsed disease."

Sexual reproduction depends on the fusion of gametes (sperm and eggs) during fertilisation followed by implantation of the resulting embryo in the lining of the womb (the endometrium). Gametes halve their genome in preparation for fertilisation during a specialized cell division known as meiosis. The process by which meiosis is co-ordinated with gamete formation in females is poorly understood, principally because it commences in utero and is not completed until decades later when the mature egg is ovulated and fertilised. 
To address the many gaps in our knowledge of the development of the germline and reproductive system in humans, we propose to generate a comprehensive cell atlas of the gonads fetal development and human germline. We will combine gene-expression profiling at the single-cell level and atac-seq with new methods of gene-expression detection directly on the tissue to study the cellular environment at an unprecedented resolution and coverage.

Many of the genetic changes are non-random and recurrent, probably because they provide a selective growth advantage to the undifferentiated cells. Some are shared by embryonal carcinoma cells, the malignant counterparts of ES cells. The origins of these growth advantages are poorly understood, but may come from altered cell cycle dynamics, resistance to apoptosis or altered patterns of differentiation. Less is known about the nature and consequences of epigenetic changes, but it is likely that these similarly affect hPSC behaviour; e.g., enhanced expression of DLK1, an imprinted gene, is associated with altered hPSC growth (Enver et al 2005). Inevitably, these genetic and epigenetic changes will impact on our ability to use hPSC for regenerative medicine, either because malignant transformation of the undifferentiated cells or their differentiated derivatives to be used for transplantation compromises safety, or because they impede the function of those differentiated derivatives, or because they affect the efficiency with which the undifferentiated cells can be expanded and differentiated into desired cell types. Focusing initially upon the existing clinical grade hESC lines, later moving to iPSC, we will Consolidate and extend knowledge of the rate, type and functional impact of the genetic variations that occur during hPSC culture. We will use whole genome and exome sequencing as well as SNP arrays, together with clonal analysis and other cytogenetics techniques. Common changes will be compared with those found in the normal human population, at low frequency in the original cell population or observed during iPSC generation in the HIPSCI project currently based at the WTSI. These studies will provide a better understanding of the range of genetic changes that occur in hPSC beyond the CNVs already identified. In conjunction with cancer genome resources and expertise at WTSI, bioinformatic analyses of these hPSC data will allow us to assess potential impact on hPSC behaviour pertinent to applications in regenerative medicine, notably the likelihood that specific changes arising in undifferentiated PSC cultures may be associated with potential malignant transformation of differentiated progeny.

EGAS00001002332,huipsdm  mtb,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a successive pathogen in part due to its ability to establish primary infection in host macrophages, thereby subverting the normal immune response.  M.tb had been very difficult to genetically manipulate until pioneering developments in the area of phage mediated homologous recombineering technology were  established by our lab and culminated in a library of mutant bacteria.  In an effort to more thoroughly study the interaction between host and microbe, we propose to establish a new in vitro infection model using macrophages derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells).  iPS derived macrophages hold much promise as a new model system in that they are more like a host primary cell, the cell number is limitless and complete gene deletions in these human cells can be achieved. The use of iPS derived macrophage parental lines and subsequent gene knock-outs in conjunction with a library of M.tb mutants will provide us with keen insight into this pathogen-host interaction to be able to develop a better vaccine and new drug target candidates.

Led by Mike Stratton, together with Paul Brennan, Ludmil Alexandrov, Allan Balmain, David Phillips and Peter Campbell, this large-scale international research endeavour was awarded a Cancer Research UK Grand Challenge. 

Different patterns of somatic mutation are generated by the different environmental, lifestyle and genetic factors that cause cancer, many of them are still unknown. Within Mutographs, the International Agency for Research on Cancer is coordinating the recruitment of 5000 individuals with cancer (colorectal, renal, pancreatic, oesophageal adenocarcinoma or oesophageal squamous cancers) across 5 continents to explore whether different mutational signatures explain marked variation in incidence. In brief, through an international network of collaborators around the world, biological materials are collected, along with demographic, histological, clinical and questionnaire data. Whole genome sequences of tumour-germline DNA pairs are generated at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (Illumina HiSeqX, 40X and 20X depth respectively). Somatic mutational signatures are subsequently extracted by non-negative matrix factorisation methods and correlated with risk factors data. 

Through an enhanced understanding of cancer aetiology, Mutographs unprecedented effort is anticipated to outline modifiable risk factors, lead to new approaches to prevent cancer, and provide opportunities to empower early detection, refine high-risk groups and contribute to further therapeutic development."

Many of these Chromatin Modifying Genes (CMG) genes are broadly expressed, including in accessible tissue(s) that have been sampled from the affected offspring (blood and saliva). Previously, it has been shown by us and others that many of these CMG gene disorders also possess a distinct methylation signature shared by pathogenic variants, and that these signatures can potentially be discriminating enough to inform diagnosis of new cases, especially of Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS). Handsaker’s PhD project has validated a previously published NSD1 methylation signature and has confirmed that this signature is robust and reliable across different methylation arrays and sites. Thus far, this signature has been validated using the Illumina EPIC (850K) methylation array run at Sanger, and Illumina 450K array data generated by Rosanna Weksberg’s group, in Toronto. Juliet has shown that the NSD1 methylation signature can be detected ab initio with as few as 5 probands and 6 negative controls.                                                                                                                                                  In the proposed project, DNA derived from whole blood from 5 probands with a confirmed pathogenic de novo NSD1 variant and 6 negative controls will be Oxford Nanopore sequenced with the purpose of calling both the pathogenic DNA variant and identifying the established methylation signature in a single readout. Negative controls will be chosen from a set of DDD probands with pathogenic mutations in a gene not expressed in blood and control methylation status validated on the EPIC array. We will also include an additional proband suspected on the basis of clinical phenotype to have Sotos syndrome (caused by mutations in NSD1) with a de novo synonymous variant predicted to disrupt splicing.

As in vivo macrophages are often difficult to obtain, in vitro macrophage models are often used. We aggregated public expression data to define consensus expression profiles for eight commonly-used in vitro macrophage models and built the classifier macIDR, capable of distinguishing macrophage subsets with high accuracy (&gt;0.95). Classification of in vivo macrophages suggested that alveolar macrophages resembled interleukin-10 activated macrophages in general whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients displayed decreased similarity to interferon-γ stimulated macrophages. Adipose tissue-derived macrophages were classified as unstimulated macrophages, but would resemble LPS-stimulated macrophages more in diabetic-obese patients. Rheumatoid arthritic synovial macrophages were similar to macrophages stimulated with interleukin-10 or interferon-γ. Altogether, our results suggest that macIDR is capable of identifying in vitro macrophages. By projecting in vivo macrophages onto the in vitro macrophages, we were capable of elucidating macrophage-specific changes as a result of tissue and disease."

We recently reported novel recurrent nonsynonymous mutations in the MYO5B gene in metastatic PPGL. Here, we explored the functional impact of these MYO5B mutations, and analyzed MYO5B expression in primary PPGL tumor cases in relation to mutation status.Immunohistochemistry and mRNA expression analysis in 30 primary PPGL tumors revealed an increased MYO5B expression in metastatic compared to non-metastatic tumor cases. In addition, subcellular localization of MYO5B protein was altered from cytoplasmatic to membranous in some metastatic tumors, and the strongest and most abnormal expression pattern was observed in a PGL case harboring a MYO5B:p.G1611S mutation. Mutation analysis of additional PPGL tumors revealed additional, and hence recurrent, mutations in the paralog MYO5A. Three missense mutations in MYO5B were functionally studied using site directed mutagenesis and stable transfection into human neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-AS) and embryonic kidney cells (HEK293 cell line). Functional analysis of the mutants verified a significant increased proliferation rate in all MYO5B mutated clones (p.L587P,  p.G1611S, and p.R1641C).  The two somatically derived mutations p.L587P and p.G1611S were also found to increase the migration rate, and all three mutants affected intracellular transport by increased transferrin uptake. Downstream expression analysis of MYO5B mutants demonstrated a transcriptional activation of genes involved in glucose metabolism, proliferation, homeostasis, and migration. Our study validates the functional role of novel MYO5B mutations in proliferation and migration, and suggest the MYO5-pathway to be involved the malignant progression of PPGL tumors."

This indicates that these mixed-lineage tumor cells are highly plastic with mixed features of different types of NSCLC. Both of the CNV patterns and mitochondrial mutations  clearly showed that the mixed-lineage and single-lineage tumor cells in the same patient had common tumor ancestors rather than independent different origins. Based on the pseudotime trajectory of gene expression dynamics from normal epithelial cells to cancer cells, we identified a set ofa cancer specific gene set has been identifiedcancer specifically expressed genes, including AKR1B1 and RAMP1.

Its initial activity in soft tissue sarcoma (STS) was described by Sleijfer et al. (2009) where a high proportion of leiomyosarcoma (LMS) (44%) and synovial sarcoma (49%) patients remained without progression at 12 weeks. Based on these findings, a multi-institutional randomized placebo controlled phase III trial was conducted (PALLETTE trial) to investigate the activity of pazopanib in the treatment of sarcomas excluding liposarcomas (van der Graaf WT et al. Lancet 2012; 379:1879). There, a large proportion of the patients tested were of LMS histology (42; 29%) and the overall median progression free survival (PFS) was 4.6 months for the treatment as compared to 1.6 months in the placebo arm. There was no survival advantage in the pazopanib arm. Partial response rate was as low as 6% and stable disease occurred in 67% patients compared to 38% in the placebo arm. Progressive disease was observed in 23% of patients receiving pazopanib. Based on this study, pazopanib is currently approved for the treatment of advanced non-adipogenic STS patients for which standard chemotherapy has failed.

Importantly, inhibition of AXL sensitized AML stem/progenitor cells to venetoclax treatment, with strong synergistic effects in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, single-cell RNA-sequencing and functional validation studies uncovered that AXL inhibition or in combination with venetoclax potentially targets intrinsic metabolic vulnerabilities of AML stem/progenitor cells, which shows a distinct transcriptomic profile and inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. These findings have direct translational impact on the treatment of AML and other cancers with high AXL activity."

Here we describe droplet- and plate-based single cell RNA sequencing applied to ~75,000 human lung and blood cells, combined with a multi-pronged cell annotation approach, which have allowed us to define the gene expression profiles and anatomical locations of 58 cell populations in the human lung, including 41 of 45 previously known cell types or subtypes and 14 new ones.

We postulated a higher efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in early-stage colon cancers. In the exploratory NICHE study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03026140), patients with dMMR or pMMR tumors received a single dose of ipilimumab and two doses of nivolumab before surgery, the pMMR group with or without celecoxib. The primary objective was safety and feasibility; 40 patients with 21 dMMR and 20 pMMR tumors were treated, and 3 patients received nivolumab monotherapy in the safety run-in. Treatment was well tolerated and all patients underwent radical resections without delays, meeting the primary endpoint. Of the patients who received ipilimumab + nivolumab (20 dMMR and 15 pMMR tumors), 35 were evaluable for efficacy and translational endpoints. Pathological response was observed in 20/20 (100%; 95% exact confidence interval (CI): 86–100%) dMMR tumors, with 19 major pathological responses (MPRs, ≤10% residual viable tumor) and 12 pathological complete responses. In pMMR tumors, 4/15 (27%; 95% exact CI: 8–55%) showed pathological responses, with 3 MPRs and 1 partial response. CD8+PD-1+ T cell infiltration was predictive of response in pMMR tumors. These data indicate that neoadjuvant immunotherapy may have the potential to become the standard of care for a defined group of colon cancer patients when validated in larger studies with at least 3 years of disease-free survival data."

Disordered epigenetic regulation is a hallmark of many tumors, and while analysis of DNA methylation of limited numbers of genes or ALL samples suggests epigenetic alterations may also be important, a large-scale integrative genome-wide analysis evaluating DNA methylation in ALL has not been performed. Here, we report an integrated epigenomic, transcriptional and genetic analysis of 167 childhood ALL cases, comprising B-progenitor ALL with hyperdiploidy (N=26), ETV6-RUNX1 (N=27), TCF3-PBX1 (N=9), BCR-ABL1 (N=19), rearrangement of MLL (MLLr) (N=20), rearrangement of CRLF2 (N=11, CRLF2r), deletion of ERG (N=11), miscellaneous or normal karyotype (N=14), and T-lineage ALL (N=30), including 4 MLLr cases and 7 cases with early T-cell precursor immunophenotype. Genome-wide profiling of structural DNA alterations was performed for all cases using Affymetrix 500K and SNP 6.0 arrays. Affymetrix U133A gene expression profiling data was available for 154 cases. Genome-wide methylation profiling was performed using the HELP microarray assay, which measures methylation at approximately 50,000 CpGs distributed among 22,722 Refseq promoters. Methylation data was compared to that of normal pro-B (CD34+CD19+sIg-), pre-B (CD34-CD19+sIg-) and mature B (CD34-CD19+sIg+) cells FACS-sorted from bone marrow of 6 healthy individuals. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the top 4043 most variable methylation probesets identified 9 B-ALL clusters with significant correlation to specific genetic lesions including ETV6-RUNX1, MLLr, BCR-ABL1, CRLF2r, TCF3-PBX1 and ERG deletion.  T-ALLs and hyperdiploid B-ALLs also defined specific DNA methylation clusters.  Supervised analysis including limma and ANOVA identified distinct DNA methylation signatures for each subtype. Notably, the strength of these signatures was subtype dependent, with more differentially methylated genes observed in ALL cases with genetic alterations targeting transcriptional regulators (e.g. ETV6-RUNX1 and MLLr) and fewer genes in cases with alterations deregulating cytokine receptor signaling (e.g. CRLF2r). Aberrant DNA methylation affected specific and distinct biological processes in the various leukemia subtypes implicating epigenetic regulation of these pathways in the pathogenesis of these different forms of ALL (e.g. TGFB and TNF in ERG deleted leukemias; telomere and centriole regulation in BCR-ABL1 ALL).  Aberrantly methylated genes were also enriched for binding sites of known or suspected oncogenic transcription factors that might represent cooperative influences in establishing the phenotype of the various B-ALL subtypes. Most importantly, an integrated analysis of methylation and gene expression of these ALL subtypes demonstrated striking inversely correlated expression of the corresponding gene transcripts.   The methylation signatures of each subtype exhibited only partial overlap with those of normal B cells, indicating that the signatures do not simply reflect stage of lymphoid maturation. In a separate approach, we discovered that 81 genes showed consistent aberrant methylation across all ALL subtypes, including the tumor suppressor PDZD2, HOXA5, HOXA6 and MSH2. Inverse correlation with expression was confirmed in 66% of these genes.  These data suggest the existence of a common epigenetic pathway underlying the malignant transformation of lymphoid precursor cells. Integrative genetic and epigenetic analysis revealed hypermethylation of genes on trisomic chromosomes that do not show increased expression, suggesting that epigenetic silencing may control genes within amplified regions and explain why only selected genes are overexpressed. Finally, analysis of individual genes targeted by recurring copy number alterations in ALL revealed a subset of genes also targeted by abnormal methylation, with corresponding changes in gene expression (e.g. ERG, GAB1), suggesting that such genes are inactivated far more frequently than suggested by genetic analyses alone.  Collectively, the data support a key role of epigenetic gene regulation in the pathogenesis of ALL, and point towards a scenario where genetic and epigenetic lesions cooperatively determine disease phenotype.

EGAS00001004454, molecular signature  il 10 producing th1 cells  protozoan parasitic diseases,"Control of the intracellular parasites that cause malaria and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is dependent on the generation of pro-inflammatory, IFNγ+ Tbet+ CD4+ T (Th1) cells by infected hosts. Immunoregulatory IL-10 produced by Th1 cells serves to mitigate subsequent inflammation and related disease pathology. However, these IL-10-producing Th1 (Tr1) cells can also not only promote parasite persistence, but may impair immunity to re-infection and potential vaccine efficacy. Here, we identify molecular and phenotypic signatures that distinguish Th1 cells from Tr1 cells in both experimental VL, caused by infection of C57BL/6 mice with the human parasite Leishmania donovani, and in Plasmodium falciparum-infected humans participating in controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) studies. Such characterisations allow for the better understanding of Tr1 cell development and function in the context of these parasitic diseases, and for the identification of targets for immune modulation to improve anti-parasitic immunity."

EGAS00001005414,adult type granulosa cell tumour   ovary,"A recurrent mutation in FOXL2 (c.402C&gt;G; p.C134W) is present in over 95% of adult-type granulosa cell tumours (AGCTs). In contrast, various loss-of-function mutations in FOXL2 lead to the development of blepharophimosis, ptosis and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). BPES is characterized by an eyelid malformation often accompanied with primary ovarian insufficiency but not granulosa cell tumours. Two recent studies suggest that FOXL2 C402G is a gain or change-of-function mutation with altered DNA-binding specificity. Another study proposes that FOXL2 C402G is selectively targeted for degradation inducing somatic haploinsufficiency suggesting its role as a tumour suppressor. The latter study relies on data indicative of an FOXL2 allelic imbalance in AGCTs. Here we present RNA-seq data as genetic evidence that no real allelic imbalance is observed at the transcriptomic level in AGCTs. Additionally, there is no loss of protein expression in tumours harboring the mutated allele. These data and other features of this mutation as compared to other oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes argue strongly against FOXL2 being a tumour suppressor in this context. Given the likelihood that FOXL2 C402G is oncogenic, targeting the variant protein or its downstream consequences is the most viable path forward to identifying an effective treatment for this cancer."

The estimated incidence and prevalence for CMD is 4.65/100,000 and 0.68/100,000 respectively, although these are probably an underestimate. Patients present at birth or within the first few months of life with hypotonia and muscle weakness. Other features include eye and brain abnormalities, joint contractures, respiratory and cardiac involvement and skin changes. The majority are severely progressive and there is no treatment available. There are 24 known causative genes (LAMA2, COL6A1, COL6A2, COL6A3, COL12A1, ITGA7, ITGA9, SEPN1, LMNA, CHKB, POMT1, POMT2, POMGNT1, FKTN, FKRP, LARGE, DPM3, DPM2, DAG1, DOLK, ISPD, B3GNT1, B3GALNT2, GMPPB) . Except for collagen genes and LMNA, in most cases mutations are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Several of these genes have been identified very recently by Whole-Exome-Sequencing (for example COL12A1, B3GALNT2 and GMPPB) demonstrating the suitability of this technique in the field of muscular dystrophies. However, there are patients in whom all known genetic forms have been excluded which are clinically and pathologically undistinguishable from genetically defined forms. A recent study of the UK population indicates that collagen VI defects are the most common subgroup (which is also our experience in the Spanish population).  However, in that same study a genetic diagnosis could not be reached in 50% of CMD cases after testing of all genes. Diagnosis is based on clinical assessment and analysis of muscle biopsy or fibroblast cultures using antibodies that recognise the primary or secondary defective proteins such as collagen VI, α-dystroglycan and laminin-α2, although these are not always conclusive and there is overlap between different forms (for example in the dystroglycanopathies). Brain and muscle magnetic resonance imaging can also help towards diagnosis. A combination of these techniques is used to guide gene sequencing which is often done one a gene by gene basis or sometimes using panels for a selection of genes. Prenatal diagnosis can be performed in some cases."
EGAS00001003238,fibroblast heterogeneity drives metastatic spread  breast cancer  distinct mechanisms,"The major cause of death among breast cancer patients is metastatic dissemination, suggesting that understanding the mechanisms driving this process remains an unmet medical need. Here, by concomitantly using 5 markers, we identify 4 Carcinoma-Associated Fibroblasts (CAF) subsets in primary tumors and corresponding metastatic lymph nodes (LN). Two CAF subsets, called CAF-S1 and CAF-S4, correlate with the proportion of cancer cells in invaded LN and exert distinct functions in tumor cell spread. CAF-S1 promote cancer cell migration and initiates an epithelial to mesenchymal transition through a CXCL12 / TGFb positive loop. For their part, the highly contractile CAF-S4 foster cancer cell motility and invasion in 3-dimensional matrix via Notch pathway activation. Finally, CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 accumulation in LN is a new prognostic factor at diagnostic, independent of breast cancer subtypes and LN status, strengthening the validity of our findings in human breast cancer pathophysiology."

While conventional genomic markers (tumor mutation burden, neoantigen load) and degree of CD8+ T cell infiltration were not associated with clinical response, we discovered numerous chromosomal alterations in advanced ccRCC associated with response or resistance to PD-1 blockade. These advanced tumors were highly CD8+ T cell infiltrated, with only 22% and 5% with an immune desert and immune excluded phenotype, respectively.

Here we use whole exome, RNA and T cell receptor sequencing, imaging mass cytometry, immunohistochemistry and PD1-PDL1 interaction detection to profile 543 regions from 16 colorectal cancers (CRCs) subsequently treated with Pembrolizumab or Nivolumab. Independent of treatment response, CRCs express low levels of PD1 and PDL1 proteins and form less PD1-PDL1 complex than other cancers. Non hypermutated CRCs have no benefit from treatment, show WNT activation and low T cell infiltrates. Among hypermutated CRCs, those with durable benefit have clonal immunogenic alterations, clonally expanded T cells and potential for immune escape through dysfunctional antigen presentation. Responsive tumours are enriched in PD1-expressing cytotoxic and proliferating CD8 T cells and PDL1-expressing antigen presenting macrophages, which form high-density clusters of interacting cells. Our study shows that immune checkpoint inhibitors are most effective in highly infiltrated CRCs where they may release the interactions between macrophages and CD8 T cells thus promoting their priming and expansion in intra-tumour niches."

Genetic polymorphisms and epigenetic modifications in the SP140 locus have been linked to Crohn’s disease (CD), suggesting a role in inflammation. We report the development of the first small molecule SP140 inhibitor (GSK761) and utilize this to elucidate SP140 function in macrophages. We show that SP140 is highly expressed in CD68+ CD mucosal macrophages and in in vitro-generated inflammatory macrophages. SP140 inhibition through GSK761 reduced monocyte differentiation into inflammatory macrophages and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory activation. SP140 preferentially occupies transcriptional start sites (TSS) in inflammatory macrophages, with enrichment at gene loci encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and inflammatory pathways. GSK761 specifically reduced SP140 binding and thereby expression of SP140-bound genes. GSK761 inhibited the spontaneous expression of cytokines, including TNF, by CD14+ macrophages isolated from CD intestinal-mucosa.

To develop molecular signatures for relapse prediction of stage I lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), we conduct comprehensive analyses of multiplatform molecular profiling from 113 treatment-naïve stage I Taiwanese LUAD patients. We identify 16 nonsynonymous non-sporadic point mutations (NSPOPMs) harbored at EGFR, KRAS, TP53, CTNNB1 and 6 other genes, and find that the Non-EGFR NSPOPMs were associated with early relapse in a dose-dependent manner via variant allele fraction (VAF). We define a score, maxVAF, to aggregate the VAFs of these NSPOPMs by the maximum value. MicroRNA expression analysis shows a strong correlation between miR-31 and maxVAF. Combining maxVAF with miR-31 led to a powerful risk prediction for surgically resected stage I patients (hazard ratio = 8.65, P = 0.001).

First, human HCCs are infrequently biopsied for diagnosis and thus are not often biologically interrogated. Second, HCC initiation and progression are strongly influenced by the cirrhotic microenvironment, and the exact contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic tumor factors are unclear. A powerful approach to examine the personalized biology of liver cancers and the influence of host tissues is with patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. In Asia, HCCs from hepatitis B virus patients have been efficiently converted into PDXs, but few parallel efforts from the west have been reported. In a large-scale analysis, we implanted 93 HCCs and 8 cholangiocarcinomas (CCAs) to systematically analyze host factors and to define an optimized platform for PDX development from both surgical and biopsy samples. NSG mice that had undergone partial hepatectomy (PHx) represented the best combination of engraftability, growth, and passageability, but overall rates were low and indicative of a unique intrinsic biology for HCCs in the US. PDX models preserved the histology and genetic features of parental tumors, and ultimately, 9 new models were usable for pre-clinical studies. Intriguingly, HCC PDXs were differentially sensitive to regorafenib and sorafenib and CCA PDXs were also highly sensitive to regorafenib.

Here, we provide proof-of-concept of histopathologic classification of pediatric tumors using cell-free reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (cf-RRBS) from retrospectively collected plasma and cerebrospinal fluid samples. We determined the correct tumor type in 49 out of 60 (81.6%) samples starting from minute amounts (less than 10 ng) of cell-free DNA. We demonstrate that the majority of misclassifications were associated with sample quality and not with the extent of disease. Our approach has the potential to help tackle some of the remaining diagnostic challenges in pediatric oncology in a cost-effective and minimally invasive manner."

While the combination of cytostatic drugs and immunostimulatory antibodies constitutes an attractive concept for overcoming this refractoriness, suppression of immune cell function by cytostatic drugs may limit therapeutic efficacy. Here we show that targeted inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK) does not impair dendritic cell-mediated T-cell priming and activation. Accordingly, combining MEK inhibitors (MEKi) with agonist antibodies (Abs) targeting the immunostimulatory CD40 receptor resulted in potent synergistic anti-tumor efficacy. Detailed analysis of the mechanism of action of MEKi GDC-0623 by means of flow cytometric analysis of the tumor immune infiltrate and whole tumor transcriptomics showed that, in addition to its cytostatic impact on tumor cells, this drug exerts multiple pro-immunogenic effects, including the suppression of M2-type macrophages, myeloid derived suppressor cells and CD4+ T-regulatory cells. In addition, MEKi was found to induce tumor-cell intrinsic interferon signaling, which contributed to antigen presentation by tumor cells. Finally, the tumoridical impact of MEKi involves the activation of multiple pro-inflammatory pathways involved in immune cell effector function in the tumor microenvironment. Our data therefore indicate that the combination of MEK inhibition with agonist anti-CD40 Ab is a promising therapeutic concept, especially for the treatment of mutant Kras-driven tumors such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

This approach showed that differential methylation among tumor entities relates to differences in cellular origin and to de novo epigenetic alterations, which allowed us to build an accurate machine learning-based diagnostic algorithm. We identify extensive patient-specific methylation variability in silenced chromatin associated with the proliferative history of normal and neoplastic B cells. Mitotic activity generally leaves both hyper- and hypomethylation imprints, but some B-cell neoplasms preferentially gain or lose DNA methylation. Subsequently, we construct a DNA methylation-based mitotic clock called epiCMIT, whose lapse magnitude represents a strong independent prognostic variable in B-cell tumors and is associated with particular driver genetic alterations. Our findings reveal DNA methylation as a holistic tracer of B-cell tumor developmental history, with implications in the differential diagnosis and prediction of clinical outcome."

The initiative is led by investigators based at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and funding support from the Wellcome and NIH. This specific project will assess human development. We aim to interrogate the cellular composition and molecular regulators underpinning development and maturation through single cell RNA-sequencing/spatial transcriptomics and computational algorithms to predict cellular developmental trajectories and cell-cell interactions. We will subsequent validate these findings in situ using allied imaging technologies e.g. immunohistochemistry and RNAscope and in vitro culture of human intestinal organoids (HIOs).

We identified 2 distinct groups of patients divided by clinical outcomes, which consisted of a cohort with Favorable and Unfavorable outcomes. Compared to the Unfavorable cohort, the patients in the Favorable cohort were more likely to have higher intratumoral CD8 T cell density and/or IFN-γ response gene signature, including five patients who had antigen-specific T cell responses that were only detectable after ipilimumab therapy. Three patients had T cell responses against tumor-associated antigens (PSMA and PAP). Importantly, two patients with a relatively low TMB had T cell responses against unique neoantigens. Collectively, our data indicate that a subset of patients with metastatic prostate cancer benefit from ICTs, particularly those who have immunological biomarkers associated with effector T cell responses.

However, predictive factors for response are not available for the majority of patients with advanced stage colorectal cancer. Here we show that measurement of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels during one of the most commonly administered drug regimens, i.e. FOLFOX, allows an early, real-time assessment of treatment response. During the 48-hour FOLFOX application, we serially assessed plasma DNA and observed that ctDNA levels initially decreased during the first 23 hours. In patients with stable disease or partial response, ctDNA levels remained low, whereas in patients with progressive disease, ctDNA levels increased at the end of the treatment cycle predicting clinical and radiologic response correctly. Hence, ctDNA monitoring during treatment may contribute to an early outcome prediction with significant implications for the management of patients."
EGAS00001004093,comparison  structural variations  10x genomics linked reads  conventional illumina short reads sequencing,"Structural variations (SVs) are large genomic rearrangements that can drive many diseases. Conventional short-reads whole genome sequencing (cWGS) allows their identification with base-pair resolution, but suffers from high false discovery rate. cWGS taps in short-range information from short-reads while linked-reads sequencing (10XWGS) utilizes long-range information. 10XWGS allows linkage of short-reads originating from the same large DNA molecule with a unique barcode captured in a gel bead in emulsion. This mitigates alignment-based artefacts from cWGS especially in repetitive regions. However, the false discovery rate of this technology is unclear. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of different type and size of SVs predicted from these two technologies. The SVs common between both technologies were found to be highly specific by PCR and Sanger sequencing while validation rate dropped for uncommon events. Further, we propose a novel enrichment approach for filtering out false positive calls from both the technologies independently. To this end, we trained a machine learning model for respective technologies and used it to characterise SVs from MCF7 cell line and a primary breast cancer tumor with high precision. This approach would be valuable in understanding true mechanisms driven by SVs in various diseases."

To uncover the genomic alterations of these ovarian cancer subtypes and evaluate links to morphologically similar tumors from other sites, we performed sequence, copy number, mutation signature and rearrangement analyses using whole exome or whole genome sequencing from tumors samples of 117 patients.  These included patients with ovarian endometrioid (36), ovarian mucinous (36), uterine endometrial (15), and gastrointestinal mucinous cancers (30).  In addition to identifying genes previously known to be involved in these tumors, we identified novel alterations in RAD51C, NOTCH4, SMARCA4, SMARCA1 and JAK1 in ovarian endometrioid, ESR1 in uterine endometrioid, and SMARCA4 in ovarian mucinous cancers.  Whole genome sequencing revealed novel rearrangements involving PTEN, NF1, and NF2 in ovarian endometrioid tumors, and NF1 and MED1 in ovarian mucinous cancers.  Integrating sequence, copy number, rearrangement, and methylation changes identified specific genes that were differentially altered in ovarian and GI mucinous cancers, suggesting that these tumors have different cell types of origin.  Similarly, methylation analyses of ovarian and GI mucinous tumors and their adjacent normal tissues indicated that these tumors were epigenetically distinct.  In contrast, the number of alterations and affected genes in ovarian and uterine endometrioid cancers were not distinguishable, suggesting that these tumors may have a similar tissue of origin.  These analyses provide insights into the genomic landscapes and origins of mucinous and endometrioid ovarian carcinomas, providing new avenues for early clinical intervention and management of patients with these cancers."

Although circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) measurement has prognostic/predictive value in metastatic prostate cancer, its utility in localised disease is unknown.
Patients and Methods: We performed whole genome sequencing of tumour-normal pairs in eight patients with clinically localised disease undergoing prostatectomy, identifying high confidence genomic aberrations. A bespoke DNA capture and amplification panel against the highest prevalence, highest confidence aberrations for each individual was designed and used to interrogate ctDNA isolated from plasma prospectively obtained pre- and post- (24 hours and 6 weeks) surgery. In a separate cohort (n=189) we identified the presence of ctDNA TP53 mutations in pre-operative plasma in a retrospective cohort, and determined its association with biochemical- and metastasis-free survival.
Results: Tumour variants in ctDNA were positively identified pre-treatment in two of eight patients, which in both cases remained detectable postoperatively. Patients with tumour variants in ctDNA had extremely rapid disease recurrence and progression compared to those where variants could not be detected. In terms of aberrations targeted, single nucleotide and structural variants outperformed indels and copy number aberrations. Detection of ctDNA TP53 mutations was associated with a significantly shorter metastasis-free survival (6.2 vs. 9.5 years (HR 2.4; 95% CIs 1.2-4.8, p = 0.014)). Conclusions: CtDNA is uncommonly detected in localised prostate cancer but its presence portends more rapidly progressive disease."

We will perform CRISPR inhibition screens in multiple iPSC lines (~64 lines) for 3-6 days using several different gRNA libraries. Then single cells are sorted for dCas9 and gRNA presence after CRISPR/Cas9 perturbation, followed directly by 10x loading and single cell RNA library preparation using the 10x Genomics 5' v2 kit. The guide RNAs and the transcriptome are captured simultaneously from each single cell, and the gene expression and guide RNA libraries from multiple samples will be pooled together for sequencing. The entire project requested 72 lanes of NovaSeq S4. The first 16 lanes of Novaseq sequencing pertain to 64 of 10x inlets that are used for screens in 2 x 8 lines and 1x12 lines (2 timepoints) separately, and are covered under prelim WC10433. If the data is informative, CRISPRi screens in more individuals and single cell RNA libraries will be made in next step to establish perturbation effects for all genes in human iPSCs (under the same prelim WC10433)."

EGAS00001005677,small variants  mtdna canary islands wgs oxford nanopore technologies iter,"The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) is of interest for a range of fields including evolutionary, forensic, and medical genetics. Human mitogenomes can be classified into evolutionary related haplogroups that provide ancestral information and pedigree relationships. Because of this and the advent of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology, there is a diversity of bioinformatic tools for haplogroup classification. We present a benchmarking of the 11 most salient tools for human mtDNA classification using empirical whole-genome (WGS) and whole-exome (WES) short-read sequencing data from 36 unrelated donors. Besides, because of its relevance, we also assess the best performing tool in third-generation long noisy read WGS data obtained with nanopore technology for a subset of the donors. We found that, for short-read WGS, most of the tools exhibit high accuracy for haplogroup classification irrespective of the input file used for the analysis. However, for short- read WES, Haplocheck and MixEmt were the most accurate tools. Based on the performance shown for WGS and WES, and the accompanying qualitative assessment, Haplocheck stands out as the most complete tool. For third-generation HTS data, we also showed that Haplocheck was able to accurately retrieve mtDNA haplogroups for all samples assessed, although only after following assembly-based approaches (either based on a referenced-based assembly or a hybrid de novo assembly). Taken together, our results provide guidance for researchers to select the most suitable tool to conduct the mtDNA analyses from HTS data."

However, potential predictive biomarkers and mechanisms of response and resistance remain less understood. We report integrated molecular analyses of tumor samples from 358 patients enrolled in the GO30140 phase 1b or IMbrave150 phase 3 trials who were treated with atezolizumab combined with bevacizumab, atezolizumab alone, or sorafenib. Pre-existing immunity assessed by high expression of CD274 (PD-L1 mRNA), T-effector signature, and intratumoral CD8+ T cell density were associated with response and better clinical outcomes with the combination treatment. Less clinical benefit was associated with high regulatory T cell (Treg) to effector T-cell ratio and high expression of oncofetal genes such as GPC3 and AFP. Improved outcomes from the combination vs atezolizumab alone appeared to be associated with high expression of KDR (VEGFR2), Treg, and myeloid inflammation signatures, indicating anti-VEGF may contribute by targeting these axes. These findings were further validated by transcriptome analysis of paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies, in situ analysis by multiplex IHC and digital pathology, and in vivo study of an immunogenic hepatocellular carcinoma mouse model. Our findings highlight that anti-VEGF therapy might augment antitumor immunity and enhance anti–PD-L1 immunotherapy by targeting VEGF-mediated angiogenesis, Treg proliferation, and myeloid cell inflammation. Furthermore, our study identified candidate biomarkers for predicting response and resistance to anti–PD-L1 and anti-VEGF combination therapy."

Using ATAC-seq, we profile the open chromatin landscape of human spermatogonia, the most proliferative cell-type of the germline, identifying transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and PRDM9-binding sites, a subset of which will initiate meiotic recombination. We observe an increase in rare structural variant (SV) breakpoints at PRDM9-bound sites, implicating meiotic recombination in the generation of structural variation. Many germline TFBSs, such as NRF, are also associated with increased rates of SV breakpoints, apparently independent of recombination. Singleton short insertions (&gt;=5 bp) are highly enriched at TFBSs, particularly at sites bound by testis active TFs, and their rates correlate with those of structural variant breakpoints. Short insertions often duplicate the TFBS motif, leading to clustering of motif sites near regulatory regions in this male-driven evolutionary process. Increased mutation loads at germline TFBSs disproportionately affect neural enhancers with activity in spermatogonia, potentially altering neurodevelopmental regulatory architecture. Local chromatin structure in spermatogonia is thus pervasive in shaping both evolution and disease."

By altering the mitochondrial and metabolic states, we defined metabolic requirements of human CD4+ T cells for in vitro activation, expansion, and effector function. T cell activation and proliferation were reduced by inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation, while early cytokine production was maintained by either OXPHOS or glycolytic activity. Glucose deprivation in the presence of mild mitochondrial stress markedly reduced all three T cell functions, contrasting the exposure to resveratrol, an antioxidant and sirtuin-1 activator, which specifically inhibited cytokine production and T cell proliferation, but not T cell activation. Conditions that inhibited T cell activation were associated with the downregulation of 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase genes via interferon response pathways. Our findings indicate that T cell function is grossly impaired by stressors combined with nutrient deprivation, suggesting that correcting nutrient availability, metabolic stress and/or the function of T cells in these conditions will improve the efficacy of T cell-based therapies."

Gene regulation at BDPs is poorly understood, in particular how the cell is able to regulate them differently. Here we investigate the effect of histone Modifications in BDP regulation. In this study, we model the gene activity using different gene  expression assays, such as RNA-Seq, GRO-cap, and CAGE around the BDP transcription start sites (TSSs) using different histone modifications in various cell types. We develop a new statistical approach that links histone modifications to gene expression at BDPs. It improves over previous methods, because it is able to capture spatial dependencies of histone modifications along a promoter and leads to more interpretable results. We predict a general histone code that is independent of transcript orientation, cell type, and promoter configuration. The histone code at BDPs reveals that promoters are regulated unidirectionally, such that the majority of histone marks associated with gene expression occur downstream of the gene's TSS. By contrasting associations of histone marks with steady-state levels of capped RNAs in  CAGE and nascent capped RNAs in GRO-cap, we show which histone marks have a preference for initiating polymerases and actively elongating polymerases. Using single-cell data we show that the bidirectional histone signal of activating marks is often due averaging of a heterogeneous cell population. Our results have implications for other experiments where the  relationship between histone modification and gene initiation or gene elongation is investigated on a genome-wide scale."

On the &gt; 50 kb scale we identified global differences with respect to DNA methylation, nucleosome positioning and histone modifications in CLL. Furthermore, a chromatin state annotation was developed to identify deregulated chromatin features of promoters and enhancers in CLL. By integrating these findings with an ATAC-seq based transcription factor binding analysis we identified a set of promoters and enhancers specific to CLL that were enriched in certain transcription factors binding motifs and genes of the BCR signaling pathway. Thus, our study provides an in-depth map of the CLL chromatin landscape and links chromatin state changes at promoters and enhancers to deregulated pathways."

To discover genes, we analyse germline exome sequencing data from 516 BRCA1/2-negative women with HGSOC, focusing on genes enriched with rare, protein-coding loss-of-function (LoF) variants. Overall, there is a significant enrichment of rare protein-coding LoF variants in the cases (p &lt; 0.0001, chi-squared test). Only thirty-four (6.6%) have a pathogenic variant in a known or proposed predisposition gene. Few genes have LoF mutations in more than four individuals and the majority are detected in one individual only. Forty-three highly-ranked genes are identified with three or more LoF variants that are enriched by three-fold or more compared to GnomAD.

Multiple failed clinical trials necessitate newer approaches to understand the molecular etiology of this disease. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO) may serve as pre-clinical disease models; however, characterization remains largely unaddressed at the whole genome level. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the genetic landscape of tumours and matched PDX and PDO from patients with PDAC. Our data show that PDX and PDO recapitulate PDAC tumourigenesis with respect to simple somatic mutations and copy number changes, and capture major structural variation events."
EGAS00001004481,single cell analysis  airway samples identifies immune cell activation correlating  covid 19 disease severity,"To investigate the immune response and mechanisms associated with severe COVID-19, we performed single-cell RNA-seq on nasopharyngeal and bronchial samples from 19 clinically well-characterized patients with moderate or critical disease and from 5 healthy controls. We identified airway epithelial cell types and states vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In COVID-19 patients, epithelial cells showed an average threefold increase in expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2, which correlated with interferon signals by immune cells. Compared with moderate cases, critical cases exhibited stronger interactions between epithelial and immune cells, as indicated by ligand–receptor expression profiles, and activated immune cells , including inflammatory macrophages expressing CCL2, CCL3, CCL20, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL10, IL8, IL1B and TNF . The transcriptional differences in critical cases compared with moderate cases likely contribute to clinical observations of heightened inflammatory tissue damage, lung injury and respiratory failure. Our data suggest that pharmacologic inhibition of the CCR1 and/or CCR5 pathways may suppress immune hyperactivation in critical COVID-19."

Gastroschisis is a congenital anomaly with increasing incidence, easy prenatal diagnosis and extremely variable postnatal outcomes.  On the basis of clinical manifestations, epidemiologic charateristics, and the presence and type of additional malformations, gastroschisis could be considered a heterogeneous condition with no gene/s discovered yet.
This congenital anomaly affects approximately 1-3 infancts per 10,000 live births [Calzolari et al.1995;Parker et al.,2010]  Current knowledge about causative mutations/variants.  To date, no single gene has been linked to gastroschisis.  Some publications have tried to link this malformation to variants in genes (such as AEBP1 (adipocyte enhancer binding protein) gene [Feldkamp et al,. 2012] or the VEGF-NOS3 pathway [Lammer et al., 2008].
Previously, a Scribble mutant mouse model (circletail) was reported to exhibit gastroschisis, however recent studies demonstrated that the Scribble knockout fetus exhibits exomphalos phenotype of gastroschisis [Carnagham et al., 2013].

Pre-clinical cell models capturing the disease heterogeneity are currently lacking. Here, we describe the first pediatric cancer organoid biobank. It contains tumor and matching normal organoids from over 50 children with different subtypes of kidney cancer, including Wilms tumors, malignant rhabdoid tumors, renal cell carcinomas, and congenital mesoblastic nephromas. The malignant rhabdoid tumor organoids represent the first organoid model for tumors of non-epithelial origin. The tumor organoids retain key properties of native tumors, useful for revealing patient specific drug vulnerabilities. We further demonstrate that organoid cultures derived from Wilms tumors consist of multiple different cell types, including epithelial, stromal and blastemal-like. Our organoid biobank captures the cellular heterogeneity of pediatric kidney tumors, providing a representative collection of well-characterized models for basic cancer research, drug-screening, and personalized medicine."
EGAS00001004479,profiling  unique protective properties  intracranial arterial endothelial cells,"Cardiovascular disorders, like atherosclerosis and hypertension, are increasingly known to be associated with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). In particular, intracranial atherosclerosis is one of the main causes of VCI, although plaque development occurs later in time and is structurally different compared to atherosclerosis in extracranial arteries. Recent data suggest that endothelial cells (ECs) that line the intracranial arteries may exert anti-atherosclerotic effects due to yet unidentified pathways. To gain insights into underlying mechanisms, we isolated post-mortem endothelial cells from both the intracranial basilar artery (BA) and the extracranial common carotid artery (CCA) from the same individual (total of 15 individuals) with laser capture microdissection. RNA sequencing revealed a distinct molecular signature of the two endothelial cell populations of which the most prominent ones were validated by means of qPCR. Our data reveal for the first time that intracranial artery ECs exert an immune quiescent phenotype. Secondly, genes known to be involved in the response of ECs to damage (inflammation, differentiation, adhesion, proliferation, permeability and oxidative stress) are differentially expressed in intracranial ECs compared to extracranial ECs. Finally, Desmoplakin (DSP) and Hop Homeobox (HOPX), two genes expressed at a higher level in intracranial ECs, and Sodium Voltage-Gated Channel Beta Subunit 3 (SCN3B), a gene expressed at a lower level in intracranial ECs compared to extracranial ECs, were shown to be responsive to shear stress and/or hypoxia. With our data we present a set of intracranial-specific endothelial genes that may contribute to its protective phenotype, thereby supporting proper perfusion and consequently may preserve cognitive function. Deciphering the molecular regulation of the vascular bed in the brain may lead to the identification of novel potential intervention strategies to halt vascular associated disorders, such as atherosclerosis and vascular cognitive dysfunction."

The mechanisms leading to DNA hypermethylation and its contribution to SDH-deficient cancers remain undemonstrated. We examined the genome-wide distribution of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and their correlation with RNA expression, in SDHB-deficient tumors and murine Sdhb-/- cells. We report that DNA hypermethylation results from TET inhibition. Although it preferentially affects PRC2 targets and known developmental genes, PRC2 activity does not contribute to the DNA hypermethylator phenotype. Besides, we evidence in vitro and in vivo that TET silencing, while recapitulating the methylation profile of Sdhb-/- cells, is not sufficient to drive their EMT-like phenotype, which requires additional HIF2A activation. Altogether, our findings reveal synergistic roles of TET repression and pseudohypoxia in the acquisition of metastatic traits, providing a rationale for targeting HIF2A and DNA methylation in SDH-associated malignancies."
EGAS00001002962,wes  adult intellectual disabilities   morbid psychiatric disorders,"ost adults with intellectual disabilities (ID) do not undergo genetic diagnostic investigation as part of their clinical care and have 'missed the boat' with regard to the WES and WGS genetic testing that is now being provided for children with ID. There is a dramatically increased risk of psychistric disorders in adults with ID, e.g. the risk of psychoses is 10X higher than in the general population. It remains an open question as to how much of adult ID is genetic in origin and how similar the genetic forms of adult ID are to those being diagnosed in children, in part due to survivor bias. There is also the opportunity to identify adults with treatable forms of ID, of which over 80 have been described, thus improving their clinical management. Furthermore, analysis of medical records of adults with genetic forms of ID can help to characterise the 'natural history' of individual disorders, resulting in more accurate prognoses for diagnosed children and identifying opportunities for improved management and possibly therapeutic intervention (e.g. optimal anti-epileptic therapy).

This cohort has previously been assayed with chromosomal microarrays (Wolfe et al 2017 EJHG, 25, 66–72) identifying a diagnostic yield of ~11% which is comparable to the CNV diagnostic yield in various child ID cohorts (10-15%). The authors observed no substantive biases in diagnostic yield between different psychiatric diagnostic classes. The WES data will be analysed using the diagnostic workflows developed in the DDD study to ensure comparability between child and adult ID datasets. This study is intended as a pilot study to demonstrate the value of WES in adults with ID.

Here we show that expression of activated mutant IL7RA in human CD34+ hematopoietic cells creates a preleukemic state in transplanted NOD/LtSz-scid IL2Rγnull mice, characterized by persistence of self-renewing Pro-B cells with non-productive V(D)J gene rearrangements. Preleukemic CD34+CD10highCD19+ cells evolved to a BCP-ALL with spontaneously acquired CDKN2A deletions as commonly observed in primary human BCP-ALL. CRISPR mediated silencing of CDKN2A in primary human CD34+ cells transduced with activated 
IL7RA resulted in robust development of BCP-ALLs in-vivo. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that constitutive activation of IL7RA can initiate preleukemia in primary human hematopoietic progenitors and cooperates with CDKN2A silencing in progression into BCP-ALL."

Our study presents the first comparison of two of these techniques - the targeted approach of the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip� with the immunoprecipitation and sequencing-based method, MeDIP-seq. Both methods were initially validated with respect to bisulfite sequencing as the gold standard and then assessed in terms of coverage, resolution and accuracy. The two methods were compared using DNA from two cell lines: GM01240 (XX) and GM01247 (XY), a sibling pair of European descent. The regions of the methylome that can be assayed by both methods and those that can only be assayed by one method were determined and the discovery of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) by both techniques was examined. Our results show that the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip� and MeDIP-seq show a good positive correlation (Spearman correlation of 0.68) on a genome-wide scale and can both be used successfully to determine differentially methylated loci in RefSeq genes, CpG islands, shores and shelves. MeDIP-seq however, allows a wider interrogation of methylated regions of the human genome, including thousands of non-RefSeq genes and repetitive elements, all of which may be of importance in disease. In our study MeDIP-seq allowed the detection of 15,709 differentially methylated regions, nearly twice as many as the array-based method (8070), which may result in a more comprehensive study of the methylome."

EGAS00001004265,spatial transcriptome analysis  developmental gonads,"Cell atlas of germinal cells and gonads

Sexual reproduction depends on the fusion of gametes (sperm and eggs) during fertilisation followed by implantation of the resulting embryo in the lining of the womb (the endometrium). Gametes halve their genome in preparation for fertilisation during a specialized cell division known as meiosis. The process by which meiosis is co-ordinated with gamete formation in females is poorly understood, principally because it commences in utero and is not completed until decades later when the mature egg is ovulated and fertilised. 
To address the many gaps in our knowledge of the development of the germline and reproductive system in humans, we propose to generate a comprehensive cell atlas of the gonads fetal development and human germline. We will combine gene-expression profiling at the single-cell level and atac-seq with new methods of gene-expression detection directly on the tissue to study the cellular environment at an unprecedented resolution and coverage. Information about the expression of the myriad of cells and cell states in reproductive cells will greatly advance our understanding of the development of the female reproductive system and the emergence and maintenance of the female germline in humans.

EGAS00001000823,irish uk atopic eczema case control direct rna sequencing  skin biopsies,"Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD; eczema) is characterised by a widespread abnormality in cutaneous barrier function and propensity to inflammation. Filaggrin is a multifunctional protein and plays a key role in skin barrier formation. Loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding filaggrin (FLG) are a highly significant risk factor for atopic disease but the molecular mechanisms leading to dermatitis remain unclear.  Objective: To interrogate tissue-specific variations in the expressed genome in the skin of children with AD, to investigate underlying pathomechanisms in atopic skin. Methods: We applied single molecule direct RNA sequencing to analyse the whole transcriptome using minimal tissue samples. Uninvolved skin biopsies from 26 paediatric AD cases were compared with site-matched samples from 10 non-atopic teenage controls. Cases and controls were screened for FLG genotype to stratify the dataset.  Results: 2430 differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate p&lt;0.05) were identified, of which 211 were significantly up-regulated and 490 down-regulated by &gt;2-fold. Gene ontology terms for ‘extracellular space’ and ‘defence response’ were enriched whilst ‘lipid metabolic processes’ were down-regulated. The subset of FLG wild-type cases showed dysregulation of genes involved with lipid metabolism, whilst filaggrin haploinsufficiency affected global gene expression and was characterized by a type 1 interferon-mediated stress response.  Conclusion: These analyses demonstrate the importance of extracellular space and lipid metabolism in atopic skin pathology, independent of FLG genotype, whilst an aberrant defence response is seen in FLG-mutant individuals. Genotype stratification of the large dataset has facilitated functional interpretation and may guide future therapy development."

New bioinformatic methods have been developed to take advantage of this long read data, however much of the validation of these tools has focussed on calling germline variants (both SNVs and structural variants). Somatic variants are outnumbered many-fold by germline variants and their detection is further complicated due to their frequency varying depending on tumour purity/subclonality. Here, we evaluate the extent to which Nanopore WGS enables genome-wide detection and analysis of somatic variation. We do this through sequencing tumour and germline genomes for a patient with diffuse B-cell lymphoma. We examine the capability of currently available tools for calling somatic variants in ONT data by comparing the data with results from 150bp short-read sequencing of the same samples. We then conduct a detailed analysis of the performance of multiple long-read mappers and structural variant callers for calling large, somatic structural variants (SVs) in ONT data. Our protocol achieved yields of up to 96 mapped Gb per PromethION flow cell with average read lengths of ~5kb. Calling germline SNVs from these data achieved good specificity and sensitivity. However, results of somatic SNV calling highlight the need for the development of specialized joint calling algorithms. Our analysis of structural variants shows that the comparative performance of different tools varies significantly between SV types, and suggest long reads are especially advantageous for calling large somatic deletions and duplications. Finally, we highlight the utility of long reads for phasing clinically relevant variants by using the ONT data to confirm that a somatic 1.6Mb deletion and a p.(Arg249Met) mutation involving TP53 are oriented in trans."

EGAS00001004269,understanding  genetics  human urinary bladder tcc,"Bladder cancer is the most common cancer of urinary system, with urothelial carcinoma (UC)/transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) accounting for 90% of the cases in Europe and USA. ~25% of patients have muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), many of which either present with or later develop metastatic disease. With the contemporary chemotherapy regimens, the current 5-years survival rate is only 15%. Thus better treatments are needed.
        Bladder cancer in companion animals (cats and dogs) is usually UC/TCC. ~20% of dogs with bladder cancer have metastases at the time of diagnosis, and dogs with UC/TCC of the bladder only live for 6-12 months despite treatment. The epidemiological and histological similarities between UC/TCC in companion animals and humans, suggest they may be relevant models of the disease. Bladder cancer in cows is generally rare, however in parts of the world where cattle graze on bracken fern, tumours of the bladder are common (associated with chronic enzootic haematuria), due to the presence of the carcinogen ptaquiloside in the ferns. Given that exposure to chemicals is one of the risk factors for bladder cancer in humans, UC/TCC in cows may also represent a relevant model.
        We propose to whole-exome sequence tumor-germline pairs of primary (invasive/infiltrating) and metastatic urothelial/transitional cell carcinoma (UC/TCC) of the bladder from humans, as well as dogs, cats and cows. Our goal is to establish the mutational landscape of UC/TCC in these animals and to perform cross-species comparison with human bladder cancer. This will allow us to assess how genetically similar spontaneous UC/TCC in these animals is to the human disease and whether they represent relevant models. If so, it will help us to rationally apply emerging targeted therapies for UC/TCC across several species, in line with the One Health Initiative."

EGAS00001002604,evolution  clinical impact  genetic epistasis  egfr mutant lung cancers,"The current understanding of tumorigenesis is largely centered on a monogenic driver oncogene model. This paradigm is incompatible with the prevailing clinical experience in most solid malignancies: monotherapy with a drug directed against an individual oncogenic driver typically results in incomplete clinical responses and eventual tumor progression1-7. By profiling the somatic genetic alterations present in over 2,000 cases of lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, we show that combinations of functional genetic alterations, i.e. genetic collectives dominate the landscape of advanced-stage disease. We highlight this polygenic landscape and evolution of advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) through the spatial-temporal genomic profiling of 7 distinct tumor biopsy specimens and 6 plasma specimens obtained from an EGFR-mutant NSCLC patient at (1) initial diagnosis of early-stage disease, (2) metastatic progression, (3) sequential treatment and resistance to 2 EGFR inhibitors, (4) death. The comprehensive genomic analysis of this case, coupled with circulating free (cf) tumor DNA profiling of additional advanced-stage EGFR-mutant NSCLC clinical cohorts with associated treatment responses uncovered features of evolutionary selection for multiple concurrent gene alterations: including the presence of EGFR inhibitor-sensitive (EGFRL858R;EGFRexon19del) or inhibitor-resistant (EGFRT790M;EGFRC797S) forms of oncogenic EGFR along with cell cycle gene alterations (e.g. in CDK4/6, CCNE1, RB1) and activating alterations in WNT/β-catenin and PI3K pathway genes, which our data suggest can cooperatively impart non-redundant functions to limit EGFR targeted therapy response and/or promote tumor progression. Moreover, evidence of an unanticipated parallel evolution of both EGFR T790M and two distinct forms of oncogenic PIK3CA was observed. Our study provides a large-scale clinical and genetic dataset of advanced-stage EGFR-mutant NSCLC, a rationale for specific polytherapy strategies such as EGFR and CDK4/6 inhibitor co-treatment to potentially enhance clinical outcomes, and prompts a re-evaluation of the prevailing paradigm of monogenic-based molecular stratification for targeted therapy. Instead, our findings highlight an alternative model of genetic collectives that operate through epistasis to drive lung cancer progression and therapy resistance."
EGAS00001001960,novel cnv contribution  schizophrenia   genome wide study  41 321 subjects,"Genomic copy number variants (CNVs) have been strongly implicated in the etiology schizophrenia (SCZ). However, apart from a small number of risk variants, elucidation of the CNV contribution to risk has been difficult due to the very low frequencies of risk alleles, all occurring in less than 1% of patients. We sought to address this obstacle through a collaborative effort unprecedented in psychiatry in which we applied a centralized analysis pipeline to a large SCZ cohort of 21,094 cases and 20,227 controls. A global enrichment of CNV burden is observed in SCZ patients (OR=1.11, P=5.7e-15), and persists after excluding loci implicated in previous studies (OR=1.07, P=1.7e-6). CNV Burden is also enriched for genes associated with synaptic function (OR = 1.68, P = 2.8e-11) and neurobehavioral phenotypes in mouse (OR = 1.18, P= 7.3e-05). While only previously implicated loci surpass strict genome-wide testing correction, we identify “novel” CNVs (BH-FDR &lt; 0.05) that confer both protective and risk effects on SCZ and are predominantly mediated by non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR). Our combined data find genome-wide significant support for eight loci, including 1q21.1, 2p16.3 (NRXN1), 3q29, 7q11.2, 15q13.3, distal 16p11.2, proximal 16p11.2 and 22q11.2."

We present 17 novel primary cultures derived from patients in London, Dublin and Belfast, and together with cultures established or shared from Barcelona, Brisbane, Rome and Stanford, assembled a panel of 52 models under 2D (laminin matrix) and/or 3D (neurospheres) conditions, fully credentialed by phenotypic and molecular comparison to the original tumour sample (methylation BeadArray, panel/exome sequencing, RNAseq). In screening a subset of these against a panel of ~400 approved chemotherapeutics and small molecules, we identified specific dependencies associated with tumour subgroups and/or specific molecular markers. These included MYCN-amplified cells and ATM/DNA-PK inhibitors, and DIPGs with PPM1D activating truncating mutations and inhibitors of MDM2 or PARP1. Cells with specific mutations in PDGFRA were found to be highly sensitive to a range of RTK inhibitors, though not all such mutations conferred sensitivity to targeted agents. Notably, dual PDGFRA/FGFR and downstream pathway MEK inhibitors showed profound effects against both PDGFRA-sensitising mutant and FGFR1-dependent non-brainstem pHGG and DIPG.

However, feasibility in low mutational load tumor types remains unknown. Comprehensive and deep analysis of circulating and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) for neo-epitope specific CD8 + T cells allowed prompt identification of oligoclonal and polyfunctional such cells from most immunotherapy-naïve patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer studied. Neo-epitope recognition was discordant between circulating T cells and TILs, and was more likely to be found among TILs, which displayed higher functionalavidity and unique TCRs with higher predicted affinity than their blood counterparts. Our results imply that identification of neo-epitope specific CD8 + T cells is achievable even in tumors with relatively low number of somatic mutations, and neo-epitope validation in TILs extends opportunities for mutanome-based personalized immunotherapies to such tumors."

However, this malignancy often presents at an advanced stage and poses unique challenges to patients and clinicians. Surgical resection of the tumor accompanied in some cases by radioactive iodine treatment, radiation and chemotherapy are the established modes of therapy. Knowledge of the perturbed oncogenic pathways can provide better understanding of the mechanism of disease and thus opportunities for more effective clinical management. Initially, two oncocytic thyroid carcinomas and their matched normal tissues were profiled using whole genome sequencing. Subsequently, 72 oncocytic thyroid carcinomas, one cell line and 5 Hürthle cell adenomas were examined by targeted sequencing for the presence of mutations in multiple endocrine neoplasia I (MEN1) gene. We report the identification of MEN1 loss-of-function mutations in approximately 7% of patients diagnosed with oncocytic thyroid carcinoma. Whole genome sequence data also revealed large regions of copy number variation encompassing nearly the entire genomes of these tumours. Menin, a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein, is a well-characterized tumor suppressor whose loss is the cause of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome. Menin is involved in several major cellular pathways such as regulation of transcription, control of cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA damage repair pathways. Mutations of this gene in a subset of Hürthle cell tumors point to a potential role for this protein and its associated pathways in thyroid tumorigenesis."

However, in most instances the implicated common variants identified so far explain only a modest fraction of the genetic risk. In parallel to our efforts to identify the causative variants in the known loci it is necessary to assess the full spectrum of sequence variants for disease risk and in particular low frequency and rare variants that have not been tested in a comprehensive way so far. To this end an international effort by investigators who have performed whole exome sequencing in circa 12,000 individuals have made possible to assemble a set of ~250,000 exonic variants of low frequency â€“ defined as seen in at least two studies and a minimum of three individuals (non-sysnonymous) or two individuals for SNPs altering splice sites / stop codons. Adequately powered association studies to test low frequency variants for association to disease risk are still very expensive to be conducted by whole exome sequencing. The exome chip provides a cost efficient way to undertake such an experiment and the WTCCC will be applying this approach to eight diseases, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, bipolar, and ankylosing spondylitis. The first objective will be to generate a large set of at least 10,000 common UK controls as analysis of lower frequency variants will require large sample sizes. Each disease group within the WTCCC has established international partnerships to proceed with assembling equally large number of cases. To maximise returns WTCCC would like to utilise controls with rich phenotypic information and appropriate permissions to have genotypic data accessed by bona fide researchers through a public repository such as the EGA.WTCCC will fund typing of 21,600 samples in total using the exome array.

Here, RRBS-based profiles of 1538 breast tumors and 244 normal breast tissues from the METABRIC cohort are reported, facilitating detailed analysis of DNA methylation within a rich context of genomic, transcriptional, and clinical data. Tumor methylation from immune and stromal signatures are deconvoluted leading to the discovery of a tumor replication-linked clock with genome-wide methylation loss in non-CpG island sites. Unexpectedly, methylation in most tumor CpG islands follows two replication-independent processes of gain (MG) or loss (ML) that we term epigenomic instability. Epigenomic instability is correlated with tumor grade and stage, TP53 mutations and poorer prognosis.  After controlling for these global trans-acting trends, as well as for X-linked dosage compensation effects, cis-specific methylation and expression correlations are uncovered at hundreds of promoters and over a thousand distal elements. Some of these targeted known tumor suppressors and oncogenes. In conclusion, the study demonstrates that global epigenetic instability can erode cancer methylomes and expose them to localized methylation aberrations in-cis resulting in transcriptional changes seen in tumors."

This prospective multicenter translational biomarker phase II pilot study enrolled 30 metastatic CRC patients (67% men, 33% women) treated with regorafenib. ctDNA was assessed in plasma before treatment start and at defined time points during administration. Measurement of tumor fraction as well as mutation and copy number analysis of CRC driver genes were performed by next generation sequencing approaches. Multivariate analyses for survival and treatment efficacy were adjusted to age, gender and ECOG. Disease control rate was 30%. Median tumor fraction at baseline was 18.5% (0-49.9). Mutations in CRC driver genes or genes involved in angiogenesis were identified in 25 patients (83.3%). KRAS mutations were detected in 13 out of 14 KRAS positive tumors, in three patients without KRAS mutation in the respective tumor acquired mutations as a consequence of prior anti-EGFR treatment were detected. In a subset of patients, novel occurring mutations or focal amplifications were detected. A tumor fraction of 5% and higher at baseline was significantly associated with a decreased OS (p=0.022; HHR 3.110 (95%CI: 1.2-8.2). ctDNA is detectable in a high proportion of mCRC patients.

While pancreatic metastases (PM) are infrequent, we identified 31 patients across two institutional cohorts and show that improved survival is independent of established prognostic variables, that these tumors are exquisitely sensitive to anti-angiogenic agents and resistant to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), and that they are characterized by a distinctive biology. Primary tumors of patients with PM exhibited frequent PBRM1 mutations, 3p loss, and 5q amplification, along with a lower frequency of aggressive features such as BAP1 mutations and loss of 9p, 14q, and 4q. Gene expression analyses revealed constrained evolution with remarkable uniformity, reduced T-effector gene signatures and increased angiogenesis. Similar findings were observed histopathologically. Thus, RCC metastatic to the pancreas is characterized by indolent biology, heightened angiogenesis, and an uninflamed stroma, likely underlying its good prognosis, sensitivity to anti-angiogenic therapies, and refractoriness to ICI.

Using whole exome sequencing of 54 human HCC samples, we discovered 19 somatic missense mutations in 15 different Notch pathway genes affecting 24.6% (14 of 57) of patients. Prediction of functional impact of these Notch pathway mutations revealed HES5-R31G to have high relevance. We found HES5 to be strongly activated by Notch signaling. In vitro, HES5 reduced cell migration and clonogenicity and in vivo, HES5 inhibited MYC-dependent liver tumor formation. But together with AKT, HES5 increased liver tumor formation in a mouse model. HES5 directly binds to AKT and AKT expression leads to increase HES5 protein levels. Furthermore, HES5 exhibits a negative feed-back loop by inhibiting NOTCH1 and HES1 gene expression. In contrast, HES5-R31G appears to be non-functional possibly by loss of nuclear translocation"

To identify loci associated with BMI and T2D we undertook a genome-wide association study using 1,355,133 quality-controlled single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped (Illumina 2.5M Duo Beadchip) in 402 individuals in extended pedigrees from a Western Australian Aboriginal community.  Imputation using the thousand genomes (1000G) reference panel extended the analysis to 6,724,284 post quality-control autosomal SNPs.  No associations achieved genome-wide significance, commonly accepted as P&lt;5x10-8.  Nevertheless, genes/pathways in common with other ethnicities were identified despite the arrival of Aboriginal people in Australia &gt;45,000 years ago.  The top hit (rs10868204 Pgenotyped=1.50x10-6; rs11140653 Pimputed_1000G=2.90x10-7) for BMI lies 5’ of NTRK2, the type 2 neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) that regulates energy balance downstream of melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R).  PIK3C2G (rs12816270 Pgenotyped=8.06x10-6; rs10841048 Pimputed_1000G=6.28x10-7) was associated with BMI, but not with T2D as reported elsewhere.  BMI also associated with CNTNAP2 (rs6960319 Pgenotyped=4.65x10-5; rs13225016 Pimputed_1000G=6.57x10-5), previously identified as the strongest gene-by-environment interaction for BMI in African-Americans.   The top hit (rs11240074 Pgenotyped=5.59x10-6, Pimputed_1000G=5.73x10-6) for T2D lies 5’ of BCL9 that, along with TCFL2, promotes beta-catenin’s transcriptional activity in the WNT signaling pathway.  Additional hits occurred in genes affecting pancreatic (KCNJ6, KCNA1) and/or GABA (GABRR1, KCNA1) functions.  Notable associations observed for genes previously identified at genome-wide significance in other populations included MC4R (Pgenotyped=4.49x10-4) for BMI and IGF2BP2 Pimputed_1000G=2.55x10-6) for T2D.

The genetic drivers of this cancer have not been firmly established and the features that contribute to differences in clinical course remain limited. To extend our understanding of the biological pathways involved in this malignancy, we performed a large-scale genomic analysis of MCL using data from 51 exomes and 34 genomes alongside previously published exome cohorts. To confirm our findings, we re-sequenced the genes identified in the exome cohort in 191 MCL tumors, each having clinical follow-up data. We confirmed the prognostic association of TP53 and NOTCH1 mutations. Our sequencing revealed novel recurrent non-coding mutations surrounding a single exon of the HNRNPH1 gene. In RNA-seq data from 103 of these cases, MCL tumors with these mutations had a distinct imbalance of HNRNPH1 isoforms. This altered splicing of HNRNPH1 was associated with inferior outcomes in MCL and showed a significant increase in protein expression by immunohistochemistry. We describe a functional role for these recurrent non-coding mutations in disrupting an auto-regulatory feedback mechanism, thereby deregulating HNRNPH1 protein expression. Taken together, these data strongly implicate a role for aberrant regulation of mRNA processing in MCL pathobiology."

Yet, robust transcriptional profiling is difficult using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, which complicates testing in clinical and archival material. We present MethCORR, an approach that allows uniform molecular characterization and classification of fresh-frozen and FFPE samples. MethCORR identifies genome-wide correlations between RNA expression and DNA methylation in fresh-frozen samples. This information is used to infer gene expression information in FFPE samples from their DNA methylation profiles. MethCORR was applied to methylation profiles from 877 fresh-frozen and FFPE samples and comparative analysis identified the same two major subtypes in four independent cohorts. Furthermore, subtype-specific prognostic biomarkers that better predicted relapse-free survival (HR=2.66, 95% CI [1.67-4.22], P&lt;0.001) than TNM staging and MSI status were identified and validated using DNA methylation-specific PCR assays.

Anti-PD1 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) durably improves survival rates in recurrent/metastatic HNSCC. We report on the non-randomized phase Ib/IIa IMCISION trial (NCT03003637) of 32 HNSCC patients treated with two doses neoadjuvant nivolumab (NIVO MONO, n=6, phase Ib arm A) or two doses of nivolumab plus a single dose of ipilimumab (COMBO, n=26, 6 in phase Ib arm B and 20 in phase IIa) prior to surgery and, if indicated, adjuvant radiotherapy. Neoadjuvant ICB was feasible in all phase Ib patients, meeting the phase Ib primary feasibility endpoint. One phase IIa patient had progressive disease precluding surgery. Primary tumor pathological response (phase IIa primary endpoint), defined as the % change in viable tumor cells from baseline biopsy to on-treatment resection, was evaluable in 29 patients. . We observed a major pathological response (MPR, 90‒100% response) in 8/23 (35%) evaluable COMBO and 1/6 (17%) NIVO MONO patients. None of the patients with MPR after NIVO MONO or COMBO developed a tumor relapse after 24.0 months median follow-up. FDG-PET-based total lesion glycolysis identified MPR patients prior to surgery. A baseline AID/APOBEC-associated mutational profile and an on-treatment decrease in hypoxia signature expression were observed in MPR patients. Our data indicate that neoadjuvant NIVO MONO and COMBO are safe in HNSCC, and that particularly COMBO ICB shows encouraging effectivity. IMCISION provides rationales for future HNSCC trials aiming to pre-operatively select patients with a likely MPR after neoadjuvant ICB for de-escalation of SOC."

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is typically included in library preparations, but a PCR-free method could be an effective alternative for research and diagnostics. Peripheral blood samples (n=22) were collected in EDTA-containing tubes from non-small cell lung cancer patients (n=10) and healthy donors (n=12). PCR and PCR-free library preparations underwent sWGS and the following metrics were compared: mapping quality, proportion of duplicate reads, genome coverage, sequencing read length and copy number profiles. The PCR-free method was further evaluated on archived plasma samples (n=33) of varying pre-analytical quality collected in EDTA or lithium heparin tubes. Archived samples were from acute myeloid leukaemia (n=15) and B-cell lymphoma (n=18) patients. The percentage of unique reads was significantly higher for the 22 samples analysed by PCR-free (95.7%) compared to PCR (84%). PCR-free libraries from 33 archived samples produced data of a comparable quality, with 95.4% unique reads. All other evaluated  metrics were highly comparable for PCR and PCR-free library preparations. We conclude that SCNA detection can be performed by PCR-free sWGS on cfDNA from cancer patients and is feasible for diagnostic and archival plasma collected in EDTA- or lithium heparin-containing tubes.

The potential impact of precision oncology on this group of patients is large since their tumors might have actionable driver mutations that can provide treatment options otherwise not available for patients with these fatal cancers. This study investigated if comprehensive genomics analyses could inform on the origin of the tumor. 
PATIENT AND METHODS: Here we describe a patient whose tumor was misdiagnosed at least three times. Next-generation sequencing, a PDX mouse model and bioinformatics was used to identify an actionable mutation, predict resistance development to the targeted therapy, and to correctly diagnose the origin of the tumor. The Cancer Genome Atlas was used to benchmark the bioinformatics workflow. 
RESULTS: Despite the lack of a known primary tumor site and the absence of diagnostic immunohistochemical markers, the origin of the patient's tumor was established using the novel bioinformatics workflow. This included a mutational signature analysis of the sequenced metastases and comparison of their transcriptomic profiles to a pan-cancer panel of tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We further discuss the strengths and limitations of the latter approaches in the context of three potentially incorrectly diagnosed TCGA lung tumors.

Genes governing mRNA translation were upregulated in CNS leukemia, and subclonal genetic profiling confirmed this in both BM-concordant and BM-discordant CNS mutational populations.  CNS leukemia cells were exquisitely sensitive to the translation inhibitor omacetaxine mepesuccinate, which reduced xenograft leptomeningeal disease burden. Proteomics demonstrated greater abundance of secreted proteins in CNS infiltrating cells including complement component 3 (C3) and drug targeting of C3 influenced CNS disease in xenografts. CNS infiltrating cells also exhibited selection for stemness traits and metabolic reprogramming.

The data constitutes hard base calls at 1457295 features from the HumanOmni2.5-8 (Omni2.5) BeadChip. Three genotype-calling algorithms were used : Illuminus (Bioinformatics 2007, 23:2741–6), GenCall (Patent US7035740, 2006) and GenoSNP (Bioinformatics 2008, 24:2209–14). Data from each calling algorithm was filtered to retain only SNPs with a call rate ≥ 0.98. To obtain a merged set of SNPs, all genotypes that matched across call-sets were retained, whilst those that mismatched between call-sets were set to missing. Genotypes that were present in one call set and missing in others were also retained. The merged SNP set contained 1467876 SNPs, which were filtered for call rate ≥ 0.99 and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium P value &lt; 5 x 10-8.   The case and control groups were approximately equivalent with respect to gender and ethnicity. 70% of cases and 63% of controls were female. Self-described ethnic composition of the cases was 29% Jola, 27% Mandinka, 21% Wolof, 10% Fula and 13% other/no data. In controls the composition was 25% Jola, 24% Mandinka, 21% Wolof, 8% Fula and 22% other/no data. Median age was 49 (range 32-60) in cases and 37 (range 12-52) in controls (t = -3.6019, P = 0.0003). This data set has substantial levels of population structure, which reflects extensive networks of pairwise kinship between participants. First pass tests of association in EMMAX (Nat Genet 2010, 42:348–54) led to genome-wide deflation of the test statistics (λ = 0.982 SE = 1.74e-05) that could be directly attributed to the differing age and gender distributions between cases and controls. Modelling the phenotype to adjust for age and gender successfully controlled for this and no genome-wide deviation from the null was subsequently observed (λ = 1.001, SE = 8.7 x 10-7). Neither principal components analysis (PCA) nor tests of proportional identity by state (IBS) variance in PLINK identified significant levels of within or between group genetic variance.

A growing number of analytical tools have been developed to detect DNA methylation from nanopore sequencing reads. Here, we assess the performance of different methylation-calling tools to provide a systematic evaluation to guide researchers performing human epigenome-wide studies. 
Results:  We compare seven analytic tools for detecting DNA methylation from nanopore long-read sequencing data generated from human natural DNA at a whole genome scale. We evaluate the per-read and per-site performance of CpG methylation prediction across different genomic contexts, CpG site coverage, and computational resources consumed by each tool. The seven tools exhibit different performances across the evaluation criteria. We show that the methylation prediction at regions with discordant DNA methylation patterns, intergenic regions, low CG density regions, and repetitive regions show room for improvement across all tools. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 5hmC levels at least partly contribute to the discrepancy between bisulfite and nanopore sequencing. Lastly, we provide an online DNA methylation database ( https://nanome.jax.org ) to display the DNA methylation levels detected by nanopore sequencing and bisulfite sequencing data across different genomic contexts. 
Conclusions:  Our study is the first systematic benchmark of computational methods for the detection of mammalian whole-genome DNA modifications in nanopore sequencing.

Tumors without C19MC amplification, the proposed driver, harbor other miRNA related aberrations like DICER1 mutations and amplifications of the MIR17-92 miRNA cluster. All tumors behave molecularly similar and no subgrouping was observed. Whole-genome sequencing revealed an overall low recurrence of SNVs, but highly prevalent R-loop associated genomic instability.

EGAS00001004509,profiling  circulating tumor dna  treatment selection  patients  advanced  refractory carcinoma  prospective  stage phase ii individualized cancer treatment trial,"Background: Molecular profiling (MP) represents an opportunity to match patients who have exhausted standard lines of treatment to a targeted therapy and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can be harnessed as a non-invasive analyte for this purpose. We evaluated the success of a targeted therapy selected by profiling of ctDNA in patients with advanced and refractory carcinoma.Patients and methods: We obtained a mandatory blood draw as well as an optional tissue biopsy for molecular profiling. Whole-genome sequencing and a cancer hotspot panel were performed and publicly available databases were used to match the molecular profile to targeted treatments. The primary endpoint was the progression-free survival (PFS) ratio (PFS on MP-guided therapy / PFS on the last evidence-based therapy), whereas the success of the targeted therapy was defined as a PFS ratio ≥ 1.2.  To test the impact of molecular profile-treatment matching strategies, we retrospectively analyzed selected cases via the CureMatch PreciGENE™ decision support algorithm.Results: Interim analysis of 24 patients yielded informative results from 20 patients (83%). A potential tumor-specific drug could be matched in 11 patients (46%), eight (33%) received a matched treatment. Median PFS in the matched treatment group was 61.5 days (IQR 49.8-71.0) compared to 81.5 days (IQR 68.5-117.8) for the last evidence-based treatment, resulting in a median PFS ratio of 0.7 (IQR 0.6-0.9). Hence, as no patient experienced a PFS ratio ≥ 1.2, the study was terminated. The retrospective CureMatch analysis identified either a 2-drug or 3-drug combination option in each of the tested cases, including a case for which no therapy was previously identified.Conclusions:Our study is the first to report prospective outcome results on the efficacy of plasma DNA profiling-based treatment, but indicates that more innovative approaches to study design, matching algorithms and drug allocation strategies are necessary to achieve improved patient outcomes."

EGAS00001004698,molecular characterization  medulloblastoma pdx models,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is among the most common malignant brain tumors in children. Recent studies have identified at least four subgroups of the disease that differ in terms of molecular characteristics and patient outcomes. Despite this heterogeneity, most MB patients receive similar therapies, including surgery, radiation and intensive chemotherapy. Although these treatments prolong survival, many patients still die from the disease, and survivors suffer severe long-term side effects from therapy. We hypothesize that each MB patient is sensitive to different therapies, and that tailoring therapy based on the molecular and cellular characteristics of patients’ tumors will improve outcomes. To test this, we have assembled a panel of orthotopic patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and subjected them to DNA sequencing, gene expression profiling and high-throughput drug screening. Analysis of DNA sequencing suggests that most MBs do not have actionable mutations that point to effective therapies. In contrast, gene expression and drug response data provide valuable information about potential therapies for every tumor. For example, drug screening demonstrates that actinomycin D – which is used for treatment of sarcoma but rarely for MB – is active against PDXs representing Group 3 MB, the most aggressive form of the disease. Finally, we show that expression analysis and drug screening can be used in a clinical setting to identify more treatment options than mutational analysis alone. These studies suggest that it should be possible to move away from a one-size-fits-all approach and begin to treat each patient with therapies that are effective against their tumor."

On the other hand, chromatin quantitative trait loci (QTL), elucidated by direct epigenetic profiling of specific human tissues, may contribute towards prioritising variants for disease-association. Here, we captured non-coding genetic variants by performing enhancer H3K27ac ChIP-seq in 70 human control and end-stage failing hearts, mapping out a comprehensive catalogue of 47,321 putative human heart enhancers. 3,897 differential acetylation peaks (FDR &lt; 0.05) pointed to recognizable pathways altered in heart failure (HF). To identify cardiac histone acetylation QTLs (haQTLs), we regressed out confounding factors including HF disease status, and employed the G-SCI test2 to call out 1,680 haQTLs (FDR &lt; 0.1). A subset of these showed significant association to gene expression, either in cis (180), or through long range interactions (81), identified by Hi-C and Hi-ChIP performed on a subset of hearts. Furthermore, a concordant relationship was found between the gain or disruption of specific transcription factor (TF) binding motifs, inferred from alternative alleles at the haQTLs, associated with altered H3K27ac peak heights. Finally, colocalisation of our haQTLs with heart-related GWAS datasets allowed us to identify 62 unique loci. Disease-association for these new loci may indeed be mediated through modification of H3K27-acetylation enrichment and their corresponding gene expression differences."
EGAS00001004512, reference map  potential determinants   human serum metabolome,"The collection of metabolites circulating in the human blood, termed the serum metabolome, contains a plethora of biomarkers and causative agents. Although the origin of specific compounds is known, we have a poor understanding of the key determinants of most metabolites. Here, we measured the levels of 1251 circulating metabolites in serum samples from a healthy human cohort of 491 individuals, and devised machine learning algorithms to predict their levels in held-out subjects based on a comprehensive profile consisting of host genetics, gut microbiome, clinical parameters, diet, lifestyle, anthropometric measurements and medication data. Notably, we obtained statistically significant predictions for over 76% of the profiled metabolites. Despite using the strict out-of-sample prediction metric, which is a lower bound for the explained variance, diet and microbiome each explained hundreds of metabolites, with over 50% of the variance explained in some metabolites. We further validated the robustness of the microbiome related associations by showing a high replication rate in two geographically independent cohorts that were not available to us when developing the algorithms. We also demonstrate that some of these interactions are causal, as some metabolites we predicted to be positively associated with bread increased in level following a randomized clinical trial of bread intervention. Microbiome-explained metabolites were enriched with unnamed metabolites, and we devised an algorithm that accurately predicts their biological pathway, finding that they mainly include food components, aromatic amino acids and secondary bile acid derivatives. Overall, our results unravel potential determinants of over 800 metabolites, paving the way towards mechanistic understanding of alterations in metabolites under different conditions and to designing interventions for manipulating circulating metabolite levels."

However, the extent to which differences in genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors influence molecular profiles in different populations remains poorly characterised, as relatively few large-scale molecular studies of breast tumours in non-Caucasian populations have hitherto been reported. Here, we present the molecular profiles of 560 Asian breast tumours and a comparative analysis of breast cancers arising in Asian and Caucasian women. Compared to the breast tumours in predominantly Caucasian women reported in TCGA and METABRIC, we show an increased prevalence of Her2-enriched molecular subtypes and higher prevalence of TP53 somatic mutations in ER+ Asian breast tumours. Using gene expression and immunohistochemistry, we observed elevated immune scores in Asian breast tumours, suggesting potential clinical response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Whilst Her2-subtype and enriched immune score are associated with improved survival, presence of TP53 somatic mutations is associated with poorer survival in ER+ tumours. Taken together, these population differences unveil new opportunities to improve the understanding of this disease and lay the foundation for precision medicine in different populations."

PRIM1 protein levels were markedly reduced in patient cells, accompanied by replication fork asymmetry, increased inter-origin distances, replication stress and prolonged S-phase duration. Consequently, cell proliferation was markedly impaired, explaining the patients’ extreme growth failure. Notably, phenotypic features distinct from those previously reported with DNA polymerase genes were evident, highlighting differing developmental requirements for this core replisome component that warrant future investigation."

In 8 cases, tumor cells from extramedullary plasmacytomas were also sorted and whole-exome sequencing performed in the three spatially-distributed clones. Noteworthy, ≥84% mutations present in BM and extramedullary clones were detectable in CTCs. Concordance between BM tumor cells and CTCs was high for chromosome arm-level copy-number alterations (≥94%) though not for translocations (43%). All high-risk genetic abnormalities except one t(4;14) were detected in CTCs whenever present in BM tumor cells. Altogether, these results support CTCs for non-invasive risk-stratification of MM patients based on their numbers and genetic profile."

Genomic aberrations along with EBV-encoded LMP1 expression underpin constitutive NF-κB activation in 90% of NPCs. A similar spectrum of somatic aberrations and viral gene expression undermine innate immunity in 79% of cases and adaptive immunity in 47% of cases; mechanisms by which NPC may evade immune surveillance despite its pro inflammatory phenotype.

Due to strongly overlapping phenotypes of neuromuscular disorders, the differential diagnosis of non-5q-SMAs is challenging. Materials/Methods: For the last 23 years, we have performed SMN1 deletion analysis to 3,535 individuals with suspected SMA. In 1,715 (48.5%) of these individuals, no SMN1 deletion/mutation was detected. Review of the clinical data with respect to a possible motor neuron disorder led to 114 patients who were available and consented to participate. These 114 patients were analysed by two different gene panels. Of these, 24 unresolved patients and 49 new patients were analysed by WES or/and WGS. Results: Gene panel provided a diagnosis in 39% (44/114) of the probands. The neuromuscular disease panel with 479 genes outperformed the lower motor neuron disease panel with 62 genes with a 44% to 13% diagnostic yield, respectively. WES/WGS revealed the disease-causing mutation in 38% (28/73) of these patients. Within the NeurOmics project, we published five novel disease-causing genes (BICD2, CHP1, PIEZO2, VAMP1, ADPRHL2) and introduced three novel genes (PRUNE1, MCM3AP, AGTPBP1) with recently published overlapping phenotypes. Discussion: NGS is a powerful method for diagnostic and gene identification purposes in non-5q-SMA, and illustrate the wide spectrum of neuromuscular disorders that initially present as motor neuron disease. Gene panels with larger gene representation perform best in clinical conditions with heterogenic genetic background. For phenotypes that are not fulfilling the core clinical criteria for motor neuron disorders, a more comprehensive WES or WGS methods should be used."

We report a case of RIG that arose in the brain stem following treatment for paediatric medulloblastoma, and the development and characterisation of a matched orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model (TK-RIG915). Patient and PDX tumours were analysed using DNA methylation profiling, whole genome sequencing (WGS) and RNA sequencing. While initially thought to be a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) based on disease location, results from methylation profiling and WGS were not consistent with this diagnosis. Furthermore, clustering analyses based on RNA expression suggested the tumours were distinct from primary DIPG. Additional gene expression analysis demonstrated concordance with a published RIG expression profile. Multiple genetic alterations that enhance PI3K/AKT and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signalling were discovered in TK-RIG915 including an activating mutation in PIK3CA, upregulation of PDGFRA and AKT2, inactivating mutations in NF1, and a gain-of-function mutation in PTPN11. Additionally, deletion of CDKN2A/B, increased IDH1 expression, and decreased ARID1A expression were observed. Detection of phospho-S6, -4EBP1 and -ERK via immunohistochemistry confirmed PI3K pathway and ERK activation. Here, we report one of the first PDX models for RIG, which recapitulates the patient disease and is molecularly distinct from primary brain stem glioma. Genetic interrogation of this model has enabled the identification of potential therapeutic vulnerabilities in this currently incurable disease."

Here, we identify 8 CAF-S1 clusters by analyzing more than 18000 single CAF-S1 fibroblasts from BC. We validate the 5 most abundant clusters by flow cytometry and in silico analyses in other cancer types, highlighting their relevance. Myofibroblasts from clusters 0 and 3, characterized by extra-cellular matrix proteins and TGF signaling respectively, are indicative of primary resistance to immunotherapies. Cluster 0 up-regulates PD-1 and CTLA-4 protein levels in regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs), which in turn increases CAF-S1 cluster 3 cellular content. Thus, our study highlights a positive feedback loop between specific CAF-S1 clusters and Tregs and uncovers their role in immunotherapy resistance."

Our analyses are based on ~2.3 million genotypes from 118 ethnic groups of the Philippines including 25 diverse self-identified Negrito populations, along with high-coverage genomes of AustraloPapuans and Ayta Magbukon Negritos. We show that Ayta Magbukon possess the highest level of Denisovan ancestry in the world – ~30-40% greater than that of Australians and Papuans – consistent with an independent admixture event into Negritos from Denisovans. Together with the recently described Homo luzonensis, we suggest that there were multiple archaic species that inhabited the Philippines prior to the arrival of modern humans, and that these archaic groups may have been genetically related.

To explore the genetic origins of MEC, we performed systematic genomic analyses of these tumors.Experimental DesignWhole-exome sequencing and gene copy number analyses were performed for 18 primary cancers with matched normal tissue. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to determine the presence or absence of the MECT1-MAML2 translocation in 17 tumors.ResultsTP53 was the most commonly mutated gene in MEC (28%), and mutations were found only in intermediate- and high-grade tumors. Tumors with TP53 mutations had more mutations overall than tumors without TP53 mutations (p=0.006). POU6F2 was the second most frequently mutated gene, found in three low-grade MECs with the same in-frame deletion. Somatic alterations in IRAK1, MAP3K9, ITGAL, ERBB4, OTOGL, KMT2C, and OBSCN were identified in at least two of the 18 tumors sequenced. FISH analysis confirmed the presence of the MECT1-MAML2 translocation in 15 of 17 tumors (88%).ConclusionsThrough these integrated genomic analyses, MECT1-MAML2 translocation and somatic TP53 and POU6F2 mutations appear to be the main drivers of mucoepidermoid carcinoma."

We performed whole exome sequencing on fresh-frozen tissue from 15 NECCs and matched normal tissue. We then identified mutations and copy number variants using standard analysis pipelines. Published mutation tables from cervical cancers and extra-cervical small cell carcinomas were used for comparative analysis. Descriptive statistical methods were used and a two-sided threshold of P &lt; .05 was used for significance. In the NECC cohort, we detected a median of 1.7 somatic mutations per megabase (range 1.0-20.9). PIK3CA p.E545K mutations were the most frequency observed oncogenic mutation (4/15 tumors, 27%). Activating MAPK pathway mutations in KRAS (p.G12D) and GNAS (p.R201C) co-occurred in two tumors (13%). In total we identified PI3-kinase or MAPK pathway activating mutations in 67% of NECC. When compared to NECC, lung and bladder small cell carcinomas exhibited a statistically significant higher rate of coding mutations (P &lt; .001 for lung; P = .001 for bladder). Mutation of TP53 was uncommon in NECC (13%) and was more frequent in both lung (103 of 110 tumors [94%], P &lt; .001) and bladder (18 of 19 tumors [95%], P &lt; .001) small cell carcinoma. These comparative genomics data suggest that NECC may be genetically more similar to common cervical cancer subtypes than to extra-cervical small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung and bladder. These results may have implications for the selection of cytotoxic and targeted therapy regimens for this rare disease."

EGAS00001004529,mutational patterns  correlated  malignancy  early stage lung adenocarcinoma  multiple pulmonary nodules,"The clinical significance of findings on mutation data from multiple pulmonary nodules is largely limited by single gene mutation-directed analysis as well as lack of validation of gene expression levels. New analysis strategy is urgently needed for comprehensive understanding of these genomic data. We performed whole exome sequencing in 16 multiple lung nodules and 5 adjacent normal tissues from 4 patients and decoded the mutation information from a perspective of cellular functions and pathways. Mutated genes as well as mutation patterns shared in more than two lesions were first identified and characterized. The number of mutations/mutated genes and the extent of protein structural changes caused by different mutation types is positively correlated with the malignancy of the neoplasia. Moreover, the mutated genes in lesion samples tend to converge to certain functions and pathways in relation to cell proliferation and survival, and this converging tendency is stronger in higher level lesions. We showed a developing pattern of quantity (the number of mutations/mutated genes) and quality (the extent of protein structural changes) in early stages of lung adenocarcinoma, as well as a stronger converging tendency in cell proliferation and survival related pathways and functions. Altogether, this study provides a new perspective for comprehension of genomic mutational data and might shed new light on deciphering the molecular evolution of early stage lung adenocarcinoma."

Chronic HBV/HCV infection increases infiltration of CD8+ T cells in tumors but aggravates T cell exhaustion. We identified CD11b+ macrophages to be terminally differentiated tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and two distinct differentiation trajectories contribute to their accumulation. We further demonstrated CD11b+ TAMs promote HCC cells invasion and migration, and angiogenesis. We characterized the heterogeneous subpopulations of malignant hepatocytes and their multifaceted roles in shaping the immune microenvironment. Finally, we identified seven TME subtypes that can predict patient prognosis. Collectively, this large-scale atlas deepens our understanding of the ecosystem in primary and metastatic HCCs, might facilitating the development of new immune therapy strategies for this malignancy."

The region is unique for its key role in both the early and recent evolution of Homo outside of Africa. It has one of the first traces of anatomically modern humans in Eurasia, and was the focus of extensive interaction between archaic hominins and humans – both in the likely co-existence of H. floresiensis with modern humans, and in the introgression of Denisovans into the ancestors of its present inhabitants. More recently, Indonesia was a center of the spread of Neolithic culture by Austronesian speakers. Advancing maritime technologies allowed farming populations to treat this region as a springboard to reach oceanic islands as remote as Madagascar, Hawaii, Easter Island and New Zealand. Here we present complete human genomes from healthy individuals from multiple key islands in Indonesia and Papua. The genomes were sequenced to high depth (30x). The purpose of this dataset is to address different questions of human evolution in Island Southeast Asia and beyond, including early settlement of the area by anatomically modern humans, population structure, genetic admixture and adaptation, and contacts with archaic hominins. We employed a sampling strategy to capture a broad range of diversity across the region incorporating an average of 12 samples from each of 14 islands spanning Indonesia and Papua, from Sumatra in the west to New Britain in the east.

Exhausted HCV-specific CD8+ T cells are comprised of memory-like and terminally exhausted CD8+ T-cell subsets. So far, little is not known about the molecular profile and fate of these cells after elimination of chronic antigen stimulation by direct acting antiviral therapy (DAA). Here, we report an antigen-driven molecular core signature underlying exhausted CD8+ T-cell subset heterogeneity in chronic viral infection with a progenitor/progeny relationship of memory-like and terminally exhausted HCV-specific CD8+ T cells via an intermediate stage. Furthermore, transcriptional profiling reveals that the memory-like cells remain after DAA-mediated cure while  terminally exhausted HCV-specific CD8+ T-cell subsets are lost. Thus, the memory polarization of the overall HCV-specific CD8+ T-cell response after cure does not result from re-differentiation of exhausted T cells. Consequently, antigen elimination has little impact on the exhausted core signature of memory-like CD8+ T cells that remains clearly different from bona fide T-cell memory. These results identify a molecular signature of T-cell exhaustion that is imprinted like a chronic scar in HCV-specific CD8+ T cells even after HCV cure, highlighting the requirement of re-programming to elicit full effector potential of exhausted T cells."

We show here that persistent FOXM1 expression following drug treatment is a biomarker of resistance to PI3Kα inhibition in ER+ breast cancer.  Since the transcription factor drives expression of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) but not hexokinase 2 (HK-II), changes in FOXM1 expression can be detected using magnetic resonance imaging of LDH-catalyzed hyperpolarized 13C label exchange between pyruvate and lactate but not by PET measurements of HK-II-mediated trapping of the glucose analog 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose."

With this approach, the detection limit in each sample can be estimated independently based on the number of informative reads sequenced across multiple patient-specific loci.

EGAS00001004721,hca uterine atlas endometriosis sc,"HCA Uterine Atlas Endometriosis_sc

Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease driven by oestrogen, affecting around 10% of women of child-bearing again world-wide. It is described by the presence of endometrium-like tissue outside of the uterus (ectopic endometriosis tissue) and debilitating chronic pain. There is a lack of understanding of endometriosis pathogenesis, as well as cellular composition of both the eutopic endometrium and ectopic endometriosis tissue of endometriosis patients.There are therefore two main aims for this study. Using single cell genomics and spatial methods we aim to: 
I)	characterise endometrial cellular census in women with and without endometriosis 
II)	characterise cellular census of ectopic endometriosis tissue
 
Furthermore, we aim to establish endometrial organoids and endometriosis organoids from the samples collected and characterise these using single cell genomics and spatial methods.

EGAS00001005498,unraveling  transcriptomic profile  utero tubal lavage fluid  ovarian cancer patients,"The majority of ovarian cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage and have a high mortality rate. Current screening strategies fail to improve prognosis because markers of early stage disease are lacking. This medical need justifies the search for biomarkers enabling early detection of ovarian cancer. In this study, we explore the extracellular transcriptome of utero-tubal lavage fluid obtained from 26 ovarian cancer patients and 48 controls using messenger RNA (mRNA) capture and small RNA sequencing. Because of its contact with the fallopian tube and the ovaries, collection of utero-tubal lavage might be the preferred non-invasive method to identify localized lesions compared with analyses based on peripheral blood samples. We observed an enrichment of ovarian and fallopian tube specific messenger RNAs in utero-tubal lavage fluid compared to other human biofluids. Over 300 mRNAs and 41 miRNAs were upregulated in ovarian cancer samples compared with controls. Upregulated genes were enriched for genes involved in cell cycle activation and proliferation, hinting at a tumor derived signal. In conclusion, we provide proof-of-principle that mRNA capture sequencing of utero-tubal lavage fluid is technically feasible, and that the extracellular transcriptome of utero-tubal lavage should be further explored in larger cohorts to assess the diagnostic value of the biomarkers identified in this study."
EGAS00001004544,mgmt genomic rearrangements contribute  chemotherapy resistance  gliomas,"Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral alkylating agent used for the treatment of glioblastoma and is now becoming a chemotherapeutic option in patients diagnosed with high-risk low-grade gliomas1. The O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is responsible for the direct repair of the main TMZ-induced toxic DNA adduct, the O6-Methylguanine lesion. MGMT promoter hypermethylation is currently the only known biomarker for TMZ response in glioblastoma patients2. Here we show that a subset of recurrent gliomas carry MGMT genomic rearrangements that lead to MGMT overexpression, independently from changes in its promoter methylation. By leveraging the CRISPR/Cas9 technology we generated some of these MGMT rearrangements in glioma cells and demonstrated that they lead to TMZ resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Lastly we showed that such fusions can be detected in tumor-derived exosomes and could potentially represent an early detection marker of tumor recurrence in a subset of patients treated with TMZ."

Understanding this genetic variation can provide insights intothe evolutionary processes that shape both human adaptation and variation in disease.Populations from SSA have the highest levels of genetic diversity. This characteristic, inaddition to historical genetic admixture, can lead to complexities in the design of studiesassessing the genetic determinants of disease and human variation. However, such studiesof African populations are also likely to provide new opportunities to discover novel diseasesusceptibility loci and variants and refine gene–disease association signals. A systematicassessment of genetic diversity within SSA would facilitate genomic epidemiological studiesin the region.The African Genome Variation Project (AGVP) is an international collaboration that aims toproduce a comprehensive catalogue of human genetic variation in SSA.

Using a sequencing-based approach, GDA project aims to produce acomprehensive catalogue of human genetic variation in SSA, including single nucleotidepolymorphisms (SNPs), structural variants, and haplotypes. This resource will make asubstantial contribution to understanding patterns of genetic diversity within and amongpopulations in SSA, as well as providing a global resource to help design, implement andinterpret genomic studies in SSA populations and studies comprising globally diversepopulations, complementing existing genomic resources.

As part of this proposal we propose acomplementary gene finding strategy that focuses on the lowest end of the BMI distribution inorder to find genes that confer resistance to obesity in an obesogenic society. Thinnessappears to be a trait that is as stable and heritable as obesity; in studies of European,American and East Indian sibling pairs the heritability for thinness, defined as a weight belowthe 10th percentile, is comparable if not greater than that for increased body weight. Animalstudies have increasingly supported the existence of a particular genetic predisposition tothinness or leanness. For example, the pure-line “I” strain of inbred mice is unusually resistantto the development of dietary obesity. Other animals can be selectively bred for bothleanness and thinness. There appear to be recessive genes for extreme thinness or leannessincluding the halothene gene in pigs, the double-muscling gene in cattle and others. Similarly,Levin and colleagues have studied rats for their resistance to the development of obesity on ahigh fat diet and characterised distinctive phenotypes in diet induced and diet resistantanimals. To date no genetic studies have been conducted in thin humans. The identificationof such genes may provide explain why some individuals do not become obese despiteenvironmental provocation. Insight into the biology of thinness and obesity resistance couldlead to rational preventative strategies for obesity.A STudy Into Lean and Thin Subjects (STILTS) was established in 2005 by Professor ISFarooqi (ISF) at the University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories (IMS MRL).ISF has been awarded funds from the European Research Council (ERC) and 1,600 peoplewith thinness (defined as a body mass index &lt;18kg/m2) in the absence of chronic disease oreating disorders have been recruited through primary care with the involvement of UKPrimary Care Research Networks (PCRNs). Most of these have a strong family history ofthinness. DNA samples and detailed clinical information will be obtained. In collaboration withDr Ines Barroso, WTSI, we propose to undertake a genome wide association study using theIllumina HumanCoreExome beadchip, a high-density array with increased coverage of exonicregions. Data will be compared to &gt;5,000 UK Caucasian subjects with severe early onsetobesity (SCOOP) and &gt; 10,000 UK controls recruited as part of the Understanding Societystudy. A direct comparison of subjects from STILTS versus SCOOP will provide a verypowerful way of looking for common variants associated with both extremes of the body massindex range.

EGAS00001003096, transcriptome rna sequencing  comprehensive diagnostic tool  acute myeloid leukemia,"BackgroundAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of malignant hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow that are arrested in differentiation. In AML pathogenesis, hematopoietic progenitor cells acquire multiple genetic aberrations often occurring in the same set of genes that ultimately lead to malignant transformation. In the WHO classification 2016, six AML classes with different prognosis are identified by chromosomal translocations measured by standard cytogenetics. All balanced translocations produce fusion genes, except for t(3;3)/inv(3;3), which lead to overexpression of MECOM/EVI1 associated with poor prognosis. For accurate risk assessment of cytogenetically normal AML, four genes need to be screened to distinguish AML with mutated NPM1 in the absence of FLT3 mutations and AML with bi-allelic CEBPA mutations, which have a favorable prognosis, and AML with RUNX1 mutations which have a poor prognosis. Recently, a full genomic classification system has been proposed by Papaemmanuil et al. (NEJM 2016). In this system, the same six classes with chromosomal translocations are identified by standard cytogenetics as well as five additional classes characterized by genetic mutations in 14 different genes. AimThe aim of the study was to investigate whether whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) can be used as single technology for classification of AML. MethodA panel of 100 AML were analyzed and a bio-informatics pipeline called HAMLET (Human AML Expedited Transcriptomics) was developed in which 4 modules are integrated to detect (1) fusion genes, (2) small variants in 13 recurrently mutated genes, (3) internal tandem duplications in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) and partial tandem duplications in KMT2A (KMT2A-PTD) and (4) overexpression of MECOM/EVI1. All mutations that were called by HAMLET were validated by diagnostic data as available for all 100 AML or targeted PCR followed by Sanger or next generation sequencing on all positive AML and at least an equal number of negative cases. Results &amp; discussionThe data showed that HAMLET accurately identified all genetic aberrations with high sensitivity and specificity. In addition, in 7 AML, fusion transcripts were detected that are not measured by standard cytogenetics including three cases that lack any class-defining lesion according to Papaemmanuil et al. Moreover, overexpression of MECOM/EVI1 was detected in two AML with inv(3) as well as in five cases without inv(3)/t(3;3), and a gene signature was measured to distinguish AML with CEBPA mutations with favorable prognosis. In conclusion, HAMLET provides a comprehensive and flexible pipeline for RNAseq analysis to retrieve all relevant information for current classification of AML as well as additional information that may improve classification in the future."

EGAS00001004406,genome wide cell free dna mutational integration enables ultra sensitive cancer monitoring,"In many areas of oncology, we lack sensitive tools to track low burden disease. While cell-free DNA (cfDNA) shows promise in detecting cancer mutations, we found that the combination of low tumor fraction (TF) and limited number of DNA fragments restricts low disease burden monitoring through the prevailing deep targeted sequencing paradigm. We reasoned that breadth may supplant depth of sequencing to overcome the barrier of cfDNA abundance. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of cfDNA allowed ultra-sensitive detection, capitalizing on the cumulative signal of thousands of somatic mutations observed in solid malignancies, with TF detection sensitivity as low as 10-5. The WGS approach enabled dynamic tumor burden tracking and post-operative residual disease detection, associated with adverse outcome. Thus, we present an orthogonal framework for cfDNA cancer monitoring via genome wide mutational integration, enabling ultra-sensitive detection, overcoming the limitation of cfDNA abundance, and empowering treatment optimization in low-disease burden oncology care"

We have integrated genome-wide sequence and structural alterations with pre and on-therapy transcriptomic and T cell repertoire features for a cohort of 64 immunotherapy-naïve melanomas treated with anti-PD1 monotherapy or combined anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 therapy. While tumor mutation burden (TMB) was associated with improved response to therapy, expressed mutation burden was superior to TMB in predicting outcome. An increased pre-existing T cell density differentiated responding from non-responding tumors independent of therapy. Importantly, T cell repertoire reshaping determined by T cell receptor (TCR) clonotypic regressions and expansions reflected response to therapy such that a more dynamic repertoire predicted improved clinical outcome. Through whole-transcriptome analyses, we discovered differential abundance of B cell subsets in responding tumors, which highlights the importance of the interplay between pre-existing T and B cell immunity in shaping therapeutic response. Tumor temporal trajectories during therapy revealed distinct patterns of molecular response related to expressed mutation elimination or retention that accurately interpreted clinical response. High-dimensional genomic, transcriptomic and immune repertoire data were integrated by both a machine learning and a censored regression approach, resulting in a harmonized multi-modal predictor of response to immune checkpoint blockade. B cell abundance, expressed mutation load and tumor aneuploidy were combined to identify patients at high risk for recurrence, such that high risk patients had a significantly shorter progression-free survival (HR=9.18, 95% CI: 3.14-26.85, p=3.4e-06) especially in the anti-PD1/anti-CTLA4 group (HR=20.34, 95% CI: 4.08-101.32, p=1.68e-06)."

A subset of the mutations conferred selective advantages to the host cells, leading to clonal expansions and raising the risk for future cancer development. Capturing such somatic mutations in normal tissue is important to advance our understanding about carcinogenesis and could provide prospective medical insights. 

In this project, our goal is to detect somatic mutations in normal (pre-cancerous) liver tissue.

For each patient sample, we aim to sequence multiple lobules to characterise the mutagenic burden. Samples will be taken from patients with different liver disease aetiologies, including alcoholism and obesity, with a view on distinguishing the prevalent mutation types occurring in each disease context.

Here, we tested the safety and efficacy of CMA in NAFLD patients in a placebo-controlled 10-week study. We found that CMA significantly decreased hepatic steatosis and levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, uric acid, and creatinine, whereas found no differences on these variables in the placebo group after adjustment for weight loss. By integrating clinical data with plasma metabolomics and inflammatory proteomics as well as oral and gut metagenomics data, we revealed the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with the reduced hepatic fat and inflammation in NAFLD patients and identified the key players involved in the host-microbiome interactions.

While current sequencing technologies have been extremely successful, their reliance on short read lengths necessarily involves some limitations: accurately assaying certain genomic regions and classes of variation can be problematic. Recent advances in throughput and cost have made WGS using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION long-read single-molecule sequencer a potential solution to these challenges. Here we evaluate the potential for routine WGS using ONT by sequencing the well-characterised reference sample NA12878 and the genome of an individual with ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome accompanied by severe immune dysregulation, to 82× and 30× respectively. For NA12878, we evaluated single-nucleotide variant (SNV) calls based on data from multiple base-calling algorithms. We demonstrate that phasing metrics from a novel, reference panel-free, long-read-based method can improve variant-calling performance from otherwise modest levels, resulting in a false discovery rate of 7.1% and false negative rate of 8.5%; remaining errors are concentrated near homopolymers and in regions of reduced sequencing coverage. In the clinical sample, we are able to identify and directly phase two non-synonymous de novo variants in SAMD9L, (OMIM #159550) inferring that they both lie on a common paternal haplotype by overlap with parental genotypes at nearby common variants. This work demonstrates that methodological innovation can substantially reduce variant-calling error rates in ONT data, and that with on-going improvements in throughput, base-calling and dedicated long-read-based SNV-calling methodology, ONT offers promise as an option for clinical WGS."

Here we show that IRF5 upregulation in HL is driven by transcriptional activation of a normally dormant endogenous retroviral LOR1a long terminal repeat (LTR) upstream of IRF5. Specifically, through screening of RNA-seq libraries, we detected LTR-IRF5 chimeric transcripts in multiple HL cell lines but not in normal B-cell controls. In HL, the LTR was in an open and hypomethylated epigenetic state and we further show the LTR is the site of transcriptional initiation. Among HL cell lines, usage of the LTR promoter strongly correlates with overall levels of IRF5 mRNA and protein, indicating that LTR transcriptional awakening is a major contributor to IRF5 upregulation in HL. Taken together, oncogenic IRF5 overexpression in HL is the result of a specific LTR transcriptional activation. We propose that such LTR derepression is a distinct mechanism of oncogene activation (“onco-exaptation”) and that such a mechanism warrants further investigation in molecular and cancer research."

However, exploiting ctDNA to determine how a patient’s cancer is evolving in order to aid clinical decisions remains difficult. This is because ctDNA is a mix of fragmented alleles, and the contribution of different cancer cell subpopulations from distinct lesions to ctDNA remains largely unknown. Profiling of ctDNA almost invariably requires prior knowledge of what genomic alterations to track. Here we leverage on a rapid autopsy programme to demonstrate that unbiased genomic characterisation of several metastatic sites and concomitant ctDNA profiling at whole-genome resolution reveals the extent to which ctDNA is representative of widespread disease. We also present a ctDNA methylation profiling method that allows tracking evolutionary changes in the cancer cell population at single-molecule resolution without prior knowledge.

Therefore, CancerDetector can sensitively identify a trace amount of tumor cfDNAs in plasma, at the level of individual reads. We evaluated CancerDetector on the simulated data, and showed a high concordance of the predicted and true tumor burden. Testing CancerDetector on real plasma data demonstrated its high sensitivity and specificity in detecting tumor DNAs. In addition, the predicted tumor burden showed great consistency with tumor size and survival outcome. Note that all of those testing were performed on sequencing data at low to medium coverage (1X to 10X). Therefore, CancerDetector holds the great potential to detect cancer early and cost-effectively."
EGAS00001003714,infant glioma molecular subtype,"Infant gliomas have completely different clinical behavior than gliomas in children and adults. Low-grade tumors are more aggressive with a higher mortality rate, while high-grade tumors are more benign. However, we have little understanding of their biology and so cannot explain this behavior and what constitutes optimal clinical management. To solve this enigma, we performed a comprehensive genetic analysis of the largest cohort to date of infantile gliomas. We uncovered several important findings which dramatically change the management of these cancers. Infant hemispheric gliomas harbor unique alterations in ROS, ALK, MET and other genes found in adult carcinomas. Unlike in adults, they are typically the only alteration present and some of these tumors regress from high- to low-grade partially explaining their favorable clinical outcome. Midline gliomas harbor RAS/MAPK pathway mutations, progress rapidly, and do not respond to current chemoradiation approaches, partially explaining their poorer outcome. These data suggest that infant gliomas require different therapeutic approaches including early use of targeted therapies."

Healthy controls (HC) Vγ9Vδ2-T cells were activated by and had potent cytolytic activity against CLL cells, however CLL-derived Vγ9Vδ2-T cells proved dysfunctional with respect to effector cytokine production and cytotxicity. Dysfunction of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells was reversible upon activation with autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mODCs). RNA sequencing confirmed that Vγ9Vδ2-T cells from CLL patients have a transcriptional profile that is distinct from HC Vγ9Vδ2-T cells prior to ex vivo expansion, although the profile after ex vivo expansion is similar between CLL and HC Vγ9Vδ2-T cells. Gene expression profiling implicated alterations in both synapse formation and exhaustion as conceivable contributors to compromised Vγ9Vδ2-T cell function in CLL patients. Taken together, CLL-mediated dysfunction of autologous Vγ9Vδ2-T cells is fully reversible, resulting in potent cytotoxicity towards CLL cells."

EGAS00001003031,patient derived neuroblastoma model system ohc nb1,"Accurate disease modeling presents a bottleneck against effective translation of novel neuroblastoma therapies into the clinic. Recently, considerable intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity has been observed in neuroblastoma, which calls for preclinical models that reflect this feature. Flexibility in a testing platform is also desirable to support assessment of different endpoints and tumor cell characteristics. We present the novel neuroblastoma model OHC-NB1, propagated from a bone marrow metastasis from a patient with INRG stage M, MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma at first diagnosis. To model different aspects of the disease, several preclinical models were developed from the bone marrow aspirate: a tissue plastic-adherent cell line, a 3-dimensional (3D) spheroid culture, and cell line-derived xenografts that were subcutaneously passaged in mice. Typical aspects of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma, such as MYCN amplification in double minutes, 1p deletion, 17q gain, and a diploid karyotype, are present in OHC-NB1 and persist in all culture types. Whole exome sequencing revealed intra-tumor heterogeneity in the bone marrow metastasis reflected in the culture models. The set of OHC-NB1 cultures with a genetically heterogeneous MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma background provide a flexible preclinical testing system that recapitulates important features of metastatic neuroblastoma."

EGAS00001003656,healthspan  lifespan extension  fecal microbiota transplantation  progeroid mice,"The gut microbiome is emerging as a key regulator of several metabolic, immune and neuroendocrine pathways. Gut microbiome deregulation has been implicated in major conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty acid liver disease or cancer, but its precise role in aging remains to be elucidated. Here, we characterize the gut microbiome profile of accelerated aging and show that its external modulation is sufficient to extend healthspan and lifespan. We found that two different mouse models of progeria present with intestinal dysbiosis, which is characterized, among other alterations, by an increment in proteobacteria, cyanobacteria and a loss in verrucomicrobia, whereas long-lived humans (i.e., centenarians) exhibit a remarkable increase in verrucomicrobia and a reduction in proteobacteria. Fecal microbiota transplantation proved to be effective to enhance healthspan and lifespan in both progeroid mouse models and, more importantly, the solely transplantation with the verrucomicrobia Akkermansia muciniphila was sufficient to exert beneficial effects. Our results demonstrate that intestinal dysbiosis is a phenotype associated with accelerated aging and its correction provides health benefits. Moreover, metabolomic analysis of ileal content points to the restoration of secondary bile acids as a possible mechanism for the beneficial outcome of reestablishing a healthy microbiome. Our results suggest the existence of a link between gut aging and the microbiota, and can help to gain insight into the rationale for microbiome-based interventions against age-related diseases.

In patients with coexisting basal/squamous and classical/glandular morphology, phylogenetic studies revealed that squamous morphology represented a subclonal population in an otherwise classical/glandular tumor. Cancers with squamous features were significantly more likely to have clonal mutations in chromatin modifiers, intercellular heterogeneity for MYC amplification, and entosis.

EGAS00001003950,characterization  hcv specific cd4 t cells  daa therapy,"Background: 
Chronic HCV-infection is characterized by a severe impairment of HCV-specific CD4 T cell help that is driven by chronic antigen stimulation. We aimed to study the fate of HCV-specific CD4 T cells after viral elimination.

Methods:
HCV-specific CD4 T cell responses were longitudinally analyzed using MHC class II tetramer-technology, multicolor flow cytometry and RNA sequencing in a cohort of chronically HCV-infected patients undergoing therapy with direct-acting antivirals. In addition, HCV-specific neutralizing antibodies and CXCL13 levels were analyzed. 

Results: 
We observed that the frequency of HCV-specific CD4 T cells increased within two weeks after initiation of DAA therapy. Multicolor flow cytometry revealed a downregulation of exhaustion and activation markers and an upregulation of memory-associated markers. While cells with a Th1 phenotype were the predominant subset at baseline, cells with phenotypic and transcriptional characteristics of follicular T helper cells increasingly shaped the circulating HCV-specific CD4 T cell repertoire, suggesting antigen-independent survival of this subset. These changes were accompanied by a decline of HCV-specific neutralizing antibodies and the germinal center activity. 

Conclusion: 
We identified a population of HCV-specific CD4 T cells with a follicular T helper cell signature that is maintained after therapy-induced elimination of persistent infection and may constitute an important target population for vaccination efforts to prevent re-infection and immunotherapeutic approaches for persistent viral infections."

Patient outcomes can be predicted by cell-of-origin (COO) classification, demonstrating that the underlying transcriptional signature of malignant B-cells informs biological behavior in the context of standard combination chemotherapy regimens. In the current study, we used mass cytometry (CyTOF) to examine tumor phenotypes at the protein level with single cell resolution in a collection of 27 diagnostic DLBCL biopsy specimens from treatment naïve patients. We found that malignant B-cells from each patient occupied unique regions in 37-dimensional phenotypic space with no apparent clustering of samples into discrete subtypes. Interestingly, variable MHC class II expression was found to be the greatest contributor to phenotypic diversity. Within individual tumors, a subset of cases showed multiple phenotypic subpopulations, and in one case we were able to demonstrate direct correspondence between protein-level phenotypic subsets and DNA mutation-defined subclones. In summary, CyTOF analysis can resolve both inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity among primary samples, and reveals that each case of DLBCL is unique and may be comprised of multiple, genetically distinct subclones."

EGAS00001002777,phylogenetic analysis  treatment naive metastases   exome  genome sequencing data,"Metastases are responsible for the majority of cancer related deaths and are often difficult to treat successfully. Even for metastases that occur subsequent to treatment, we do not know whether such relapsing metastases were originally heterogeneous or if the observed heterogeneity is a consequence of therapy. Given that treatment can influence evolutionary dynamics by selecting resistant clones, imposing bottlenecks on cancer cell populations, and even inducing novel somatic mutations, characterizing the prior standing variation among metastases remains an important goal to predict initial therapeutic response. To quantify the heterogeneity at clinical presentation of advanced disease, we surveyed the literature for patients in which at least two treatment-naïve metastases underwent genome/exome-wide sequencing. Across all cancer types surveyed, only 18 subjects were found to fulfill this requirement. Including previously unpublished data from two subjects, we analyzed data of 74 untreated metastases and inferred cancer phylogenies. Putative driver gene mutations were acquired at a 2-fold higher rate on the trunk of all metastases than on branches. Mutations in driver genes along the trunk were strongly enriched for predicted functional consequences. Using a stochastic mathematical model, we find that driver gene heterogeneity among metastases mostly occurs in slowly growing cancers for highly advantageous driver gene mutations. Seeding efficiency only weakly affects the heterogeneity among metastases. These results explain why functional driver gene heterogeneity is uncommon in advanced disease prior to treatment, thus providing optimism for future therapies that depend on mutations across metastases."

Additionally, the cfDNA TCR repertoire reorganisation fingerprint correlated with the expansion of an immune-effector subset of peripheral T cells that predicted treatment response and identified the patients with longer overall survival.CONCLUSIONS: Here we show that prognostic changes in peripheral T cells occur within 3 weeks of commencing CPI treatment.

Single-cell profiling methods enable the investigation of cell population distributions and transcriptional changes along the airways. We have explored cellular heterogeneity of the human airway epithelium in 10 healthy living volunteers by single-cell RNA profiling. 77,969 cells were collected by bronchoscopy at 35 distinct locations, from the nose to the 12th division of the airway tree. The resulting atlas is composed of a high percentage of epithelial cells (89.1%), but also immune (6.2%) and stromal (4.7%) cells with peculiar cellular proportions in different sites of the airways. It reveals differential gene expression between identical cell types (suprabasal, secretory, and multiciliated cells) from the nose (MUC4, PI3, SIX3) and tracheobronchial (SCGB1A1, TFF3) airways. By contrast, cell-type specific gene expression was stable across all tracheobronchial samples. Our atlas improves the description of ionocytes, pulmonary neuro-endocrine (PNEC) and brush cells, which are likely derived from a common population of precursor cells. We also report a population of KRT13 positive cells with a high percentage of dividing cells which are reminiscent of “hillock” cells previously described in mouse. Robust characterization of this unprecedented large single-cell cohort establishes an important resource for future investigations. The precise description of the continuum existing from nasal epithelium to successive divisions of lung airways and the stable gene expression profile of these regions better defines conditions under which relevant tracheobronchial proxies of human respiratory diseases can be developed."

Clinically, PDD is classified as a ‘dysplasia with multiple joint dislocations’ however, the molecular aetiology of the disorder is currently unknown. In order to identify the genetic defects underlying PDD, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) on 3 patients from 2 unrelated families, clinically diagnosed with PDD. WES resulted in the identification of bi-allelic variants in the established skeletal dysplasia genes, B3GAT3 (Family 1) and CANT1 (Family 2). Mutations in these genes have previously been reported to cause ‘multiple joint dislocations, short stature, and craniofacial dysmorphism with or without congenital heart defects’ (B3GAT3) and Desbuquois dysplasia 1 (CANT1); disorders in the same nosological group as PDD. Follow-up of the B3GAT3 variants demonstrated significantly reduced B3GAT3/GlcAT-I expression. Downstream in vitro functional analysis revealed abolished biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycan side chains on proteoglycans. Functional evaluation of the CANT1 variant showed impaired nucleotidase activity, which results in inhibition of glycosaminoglycan synthesis through accumulation of uridine diphosphate. For the families described in this study, the PDD phenotype was caused by mutations in the known skeletal dysplasia genes B3GAT3 and CANT1, demonstrating the advantage of genomic analyses in delineating the molecular diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias. This finding expands the phenotypic spectrum of B3GAT3- and CANT1- related skeletal dysplasias to include PDD, and highlights the significant phenotypic overlap of conditions within the proteoglycan biosynthesis pathway."
EGAS00001004153, mir 185 pak6 axis predicts therapy response  regulates survival  drug resistant leukemic stem cells  chronic myeloid leukemia,"Overcoming drug resistance and targeting cancer stem cells remain challenges for curative cancer treatment. To investigate the role of miRNAs in regulating drug resistance and leukemic stem cell (LSCs) fate, we performed global transcriptome profiling in treatment-naïve chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) stem/progenitor cells and identified that miR-185 levels anticipate their response to ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). miR-185 functions as a tumor suppressor; its restored expression impaired survival of drug-resistant cells, sensitized them to TKIs in vitro, and markedly eliminated long-term repopulating LSCs and infiltrating blast cells, conferring a survival advantage in pre-clinical xenotransplantation models. Integrative analysis with mRNA profiles uncovered PAK6 as a crucial target of miR-185 and pharmacological inhibition of PAK6 perturbed the RAS/MAPK pathway and mitochondrial activity, sensitizing therapy-resistant cells to TKIs. Thus, miR-185 presents as a potential predictive biomarker, and dual targeting of miR-185-mediated PAK6 activity and BCR-ABL may provide a valuable strategy for overcoming drug resistance in patients."

However, characteristics of the origins and molecular features of cfDNA are poorly understood.  We developed an approach to evaluate fragmentation patterns of cfDNA across the genome and found that cfDNA profiles of healthy individuals reflected nucleosomal patterns of white blood cells, while patients with cancer had altered fragmentation profiles.  We applied this method to analyze fragmentation profiles of 236 patients with breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, gastric, or bile duct cancers and 245 healthy individuals.  A machine learning model incorporating genome-wide fragmentation features had sensitivities of detection ranging from 57% to &amp;gt;99% among the seven cancer types at 98% specificity, with an overall AUC of 0.94.  Fragmentation profiles could be used to identify the tissue of origin of the cancers to a limited number of sites in 75% of cases.  Combining our approach with mutation based cfDNA analyses detected 91% of cancer patients.  The results of these analyses highlight important properties of cfDNA and provide a proof of principle approach for screening, early detection, and monitoring of human cancer."

A deep understanding of the tumor microenvironment is likely to inform  on key drivers of disease progression and novel therapeutic opportunities. We investigated the role of key cell types along disease progression, profiling the RNA abundance of 52 samples from 13 patients enriched for one of four key cell types, spanning a wide CAPRA-S risk score range.  Using a novel differential transcription Bayes method, TABI, we avoided a priori patient stratification, and mapped transcriptional alteration events to specific risk scores. The developmental and cell-type  resolution yielded a landscape of concurrent transcriptional alterations from the tumour microenvironment, including key hallmarks. These transcriptional signatures permitted the identification of a “high survival” patient cluster in an independent prostate cancer dataset. Most importantly, together with our integrated transcriptional analysis, differential tissue composition analysis provided evidence for a key role for monocytes and macrophages in prostate cancer progression and disease recurrence."

While more than 90% of the ALCL cases contain ALK-rearrangement, these tumors possess significant inter-tumor molecular heterogeneity that contributes to distinct morphologic differences and clinical impact. To gain insight into the molecular heterogeneity within ALK+ ALCL, we performed whole-exome sequencing, RNA-sequencing, and methylome analysis of 42 primary pediatric ALK+ ALCL patients. Our data showed that ALK+ALCLs was subclassified into two subtypes based on ALK gene expression, methylation profiles, and somatic mutation patterns. ALK-low samples had more highly methylated gene regions while enriched with immune infiltration. ALK-high samples were enriched with somatic copy number alteration and high expression of MYC and PD-L1. These data indicate that ALK expression, somatic mutations, and aneuploidy status are negatively associated with immune infiltration, stipulating that ALK expression status might be associated with resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors."

EGAS00001002234,global anaplastic thyroid cancer initiative,"Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy. Most thyroid cancers are of the well-differentiated (non-aggressive) phenotype, and are almost always cured with standard treatments. In contrast, anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is rare, accounting for only 1% of thyroid cancers, however it is perhaps the most lethal human malignancy with an average survival of 3 to 6 months. ATC presents with dramatic and rapid onset of airway and esophageal blockage with frequent spread to the lungs. Interestingly, 21–79% of ATCs have coexisting areas or a previous history of well-differentiated cancers. Although this suggests a progression from well-differentiated cancers to ATC, to date there is little molecular conformation that such a progression exists versus de novo generation of ATC. As ATC is extremely rare and most cases are inoperable, there are a paucity of tissue samples for study at any one center. The Global Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer Initiative (GATCI) aims to unite international institutions in order to pool samples (ATC with or without a paired well-differentiated component) for a comprehensive analysis of the genomic landscape of this disease."

We investigated the genomic evolution and immune microenvironments of paired primary-metastatic tumors by employing multi-region whole-exome sequencing in 179 samples of 106 tumors from 51 lung cancer patients and subsequent immunohistochemistry assays in 70 of them. Our data revealed differences in genomic landscapes, molecular determinants, evolutionary dynamics, and lymphocyte infiltration among different metastatic sites. We demonstrated commonly late arising of metastatic seeding of lung cancer with quantitative evidence. Most distant metastases originated from independent origins of earlier lymph node spreads. Immune-heterogeneity and -homogeneity were primarily driven by arm-level and focal copy number events in primary tumors, respectively. These findings implied the combinatorial role of multiple factors in shaping patterns of dissemination and advanced the clinical evaluation and intervention of lung cancer metastasis."
EGAS00001003928,cistrome partitioning reveals convergence  somatic mutations  risk variants  master transcription regulators  primary prostate tumors,"Thousands of noncoding somatic Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) of unknown
function are reported in tumors. Partitioning the genome according to cistromes,
reveals the enrichment of somatic SNVs in prostate tumors as opposed to adjacent
normal tissue cistromes of master transcription regulators, including AR, FOXA1 and
HOXB13. This parallels enrichment of prostate cancer genetic predispositions over
these transcription regulators’ tumor cistromes, exemplified at the 8q24 locus harboring
both risk-variants and somatic SNVs in cis-regulatory elements, upregulating MYC
expression and altering the binding of transcription regulators to DNA. However, Massively-Parallel Reporter Assays reveal that few SNVs can alter the transactivation
potential of individual CREs. Instead, SNVs accumulate, similarly to inherited riskvariants,
in cistromes of master transcription regulators required for prostate cancer
development.
Difficulties in inferring the biological significance of noncoding mutations have limited
their inclusion in precision genomics medicine pipelines. Most attempts to delineate a
role for noncoding mutations relied on detecting evidence for positive selection within
individual CREs, such as reported for the TERT gene promoter. By considering the
enrichment of noncoding mutations in cistromes as opposed to individual CREs, we
reveal their specificity towards master transcription regulators that promote prostate
cancer development, a feature shared with inherited risk-variants. Overall, our work
provides a blueprint for the functional interpretation of noncoding mutations in genomic
tests relying on defining cis-regulatory units according to cistrome-partitioning to
identify cancer driver transcription regulators."
EGAS00001004135,comparison  133 144bp dominant phenotype  166bp dominant phenotype,"Background: Previous studies found that cell-free DNA (cfDNA) generated from tumors was shorter than that from healthy cells, and selecting short cfDNA could enrich for tumor cfDNA and improve its usage in early cancer diagnosis and treatment monitoring; however, the underlying mechanism of shortened tumor cfDNA was still unknown, which potentially limits its further clinical application.Results: Using targeted sequencing of cfDNA in a large cohort of solid tumor patient, sequencing reads harboring tumor-specific somatic mutations were isolated to examine the exact size distribution of tumor cfDNA. For the majority of studied cases, 166bp remained as the peak size of tumor cfDNA, with tumor cfDNA showing an increased proportion of short fragments (100-150bp). Less than 1% of cfDNA samples were found to be peaked at 134/144bp and independent of tumor cfDNA purity. Using whole-genome sequencing of cfDNA, we discovered a positive correlation between cfDNA shortening and the magnitude of chromatin inaccessibility, as measured by transcription, DNase I hypersensitivity, and histone modifications. Tumor cfDNA shortening occurred simultaneously at both 5’ and 3’ ends of the DNA wrapped around nucleosomes. Conclusions: Tumor cfDNA shortening exhibited two distinctive modes. Tumor cfDNA purity and chromatin inaccessibility were contributing factors but insufficient to trigger a global transition from 166bp dominant to 134/144bp dominant phenotype."

EGAS00001003753,dissociation  solid tumour tissues  cold active protease  single cell rna seq minimizes conserved collagenase associated stress responses,"Background Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) is a powerful tool for studying complex biological systems, such as tumour heterogeneity and tissue microenvironments. However, the sources of technical and biological variation in primary solid tumour tissues and patient-derived mouse xenografts for scRNAseq, are not well understood. Here, we used low temperature (6°C) protease and collagenase (37°C) to identify the transcriptional signatures associated with tissue dissociation across a diverse scRNAseq dataset comprising 128,481 cells from patient cancer tissues, patient-derived breast cancer xenografts and cancer cell lines.Results We observe substantial variation in standard quality control (QC) metrics of cell viability across conditions and tissues. From FACS sorted populations gated for cell viability, we identify a sub-population of dead cells that would pass standard data filtering practices, and quantify the extent to which their transcriptomes differ from live cells. We identify a further subpopulation of transcriptomically “dying” cells that exhibit up-regulation of MHC class I transcripts, in contrast with live and fully dead cells. From the contrast between tissue protease dissociation at 37°C or 6°C, we observe that collagenase digestion results in a stress response. We derive a core gene set of 512 heat shock and stress response genes, including FOS and JUN, induced by collagenase (37°C), which are minimized by dissociation with a cold active protease (6°C). While induction of these genes was highly conserved across all cell types, cell type-specific responses to collagenase digestion were observed in patient tissues. We observe that the yield of cancer and non-cancer cell types varies between tissues and dissociation methods.Conclusions The method and conditions of tumour dissociation influence cell yield and transcriptome state and are both tissue and cell type dependent. Interpretation of stress pathway expression differences in cancer single cell studies, including components of surface immune recognition such as MHC class I, may be especially confounded. We define a core set of 512 genes that can assist with identification of such effects in dissociated scRNA-seq experiments."

We have evaluated the impact of type of blood collection tube and time delay between blood draw and plasma preparation on bisulfite-based cfDNA methylation profiling.

Methods 15 tubes of blood were drawn from three healthy volunteer subjects (BD Vacutainer K2E EDTA spray tubes, Streck Cell-Free DNA BCT tubes, PAXgene Blood ccfDNA tubes, Roche Cell-Free DNA Collection tubes and Biomatrica LBgard blood tubes in triplicate). Samples were either immediately processed or stored at room temperature for 24 or 72 hours before plasma preparation. DNA fragment size was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing was performed on the cell-free DNA isolated from these plasma samples. We evaluated the impact of blood tube and time delay on several quality control metrics.

Results All preservation tubes performed similar on the quality metrics that were evaluated. Furthermore, a considerable increase in cfDNA concentration and the fraction of it derived from NK cells was observed after a 72-hour time delay in EDTA tubes.

Conclusion The methylation pattern of cfDNA is robust and reproducible in between the different preservation tubes. EDTA tubes processed as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours, are the most cost effective. If immediate processing is not possible, preservation tubes are valid alternatives."

The kidneys play a critical role in homeostasis, excreting waste and acid and maintaining electrolyte and water balance. The homeostatic function of the kidney generates substantial differences in tissue environment between different anatomical regions of the kidney. Complementing efforts in generating single-cell molecular profiles across the entire cross-section of the adult human kidney, from outer cortex to upper ureter, we aim to also interrogate whether the epigenome of kidney-resident immune cells varies across different anatomical regions of the kidney. The expression of RNA transcripts is, in part, controlled by the state of chromatin, with closed structures sterically hindering the binding of transcriptional modulators. The chromatin landscape of immune cells can change according to environmental stimuli, for example, via engagement of toll-like receptor (TLR)4 with lipopolysaccharide. Here we wish to determine whether and how the environmental differences in cortex, medulla and pelvis might impact resident immune cell epigenome using single-cell ATAC-seq on the 10x platform

The outcomes were duration of treatment (DOT) and overall survival (OS). Clinical features were analyzed for their influence on the treatment effect and prognosis. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed to identify genetic biomarkers associated with the efficacy of pemetrexed. The median DOT was 9.1 months (95% CI: 8.5-9.8), and the median OS was 26.2 months (95% CI: 24.2-28.1). OS was positively correlated with DOT (r=0.403, P&lt;0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that smoking status and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) were independently associated with DOT; smoking status, ECOG PS, targeted therapy, and EGFR/ALK/ROS1 status were independently associated with OS. NGS in 22 patients with available samples showed genes with high mutation rates were: TP53 (54.5%), EGFR (50.0%), MYC (18.2%), PIK3CA (13.6%). When grouped based on progression-free survival (PFS) reported in the PARAMOUNT study, the DOT &gt;6.9 months set was associated with PIK3CA, ALK, BRINP3, CDKN2A, CSMD3, EPHA3, KRAS, and RB1 mutations, while ERBB2 mutation was observed only in the DOT ≤6.9 months set.

Copy number abnormalities have been extensively studied in many datasets with long follow-up, however, the prognostic impact of mutations have not been extensively studied and available datasets have generally had a relatively short follow-up. These analyses have identified a range of mutations that are associated with prognosis, making it important to extend these observations in larger studies with robust diagnostic technologies. Samples from newly diagnosed MM patients enrolled in Total Therapy trials (n=225) were sequenced on a targeted panel consisting of 140 genes and additional regions of interest for copy number, as well as tiling of the Ig and MYC loci for detection of translocations.  Samples were sequenced to a median depth of 452x using 2x75 bp paired end reads.  Reads were aligned to hg19 and mutations called using Strelka and filtered with fpfilter.

These tumors are generally driven by fusions of ALK, RET, NTRK1/3, MET, ROS1 and BRAF. However, in approximately 50% of cases, no genetic driver has been established. Clinical whole genome and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) of a spitzoid tumor from an adolescent revealed a novel gene fusion of MAP3K8, encoding a serine−threonine kinase that activates MEK. The patient who had exhausted all other therapeutic options was treated with a MEK inhibitor and underwent a transient clinical response. We subsequently analyzed spitzoid tumors from 49 patients by RNA-Seq and found in-frame fusions or C-terminal truncations in 33% of cases. The fusion transcripts and truncated genes all contained MAP3K8 exons 1-8 but lacked the autoinhibitory final exon. Data mining of RNA-Seq from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) uncovered analogous MAP3K8 rearrangements in 1.5% of adult melanomas. Thus, MAP3K8 rearrangements - uncovered by comprehensive clinical sequencing of a single case - are the most common genetic event in spitzoid melanoma, are present in adult melanomas, and could be amenable to MEK inhibition."

However, due to the artifacts of a long-term in culture, cell lines do not always represent the realistic tumor cell behavior. This has motivated the development of models that better mimetics the tumor tissue, among them, the establishment of primary cell cultures. In this work, we establish and characterized a low-passage cervix cancer cell line from a Brazilian patient with squamous cell carcinoma. The phenotype confirms the epithelial and tumor origin, through cytokeratins, EpCAM, and p16 staining. Whole exome sequencing showed relevant somatic mutations in several genes including BRCA2, TGFBR1, and IRX2 genes. CNV analysis by nanostring and WGS revealed amplification in genes related mainly with kinases proteins, involved in proliferation, migration and cell differentiation, such as EGFR, PIK3CA, and MAPK7. Overexpression of EGFR was confirmed by phospho RTK-array and western blot analysis. Furthermore, the cell was sensitivity to cisplatin, with IC50 13 times lower than SiHa cell line. In conclusion, this cervical cancer cell line presents molecular alterations that are an important tool for leading pre-clinical studies of new drugs that target one or more of the altered pathways."
EGAS00001003062,ewings sarcoma rna seq,"Sarcomas are cancers of the bone and soft tissue often defined by their gene fusions.
However, the timing, context, and processes by which these pathogenic fusions arise are unknown. We explored this in Ewing sarcoma, a cancer driven by EWSR1-ETS fusions, with very few cooperating mutations. Combining whole-genome sequencing with enhanced informatics, we found that the EWSR1-ETS fusion arose from striking rearrangement clusters in 42% of cases (52/124). Notably, these were organized in loops that universally contained the fusion at their center, while also weaving up to 18 genes together with it. We found the same pattern of rearrangements in three additional types of sarcoma. From these data, we define a new signature for sarcoma fusions that precedes other somatic changes, in the earliest replicating DNA of the genome. This dramatic, sudden process impinges on many genes – generating
multiple coding changes that profoundly affect the transcriptome, with the disease-defining gene fusion at its core. These rearrangement loops emerge in an early ES clone from which both the primary tumor and the lethal relapse emerged, and then evolved in parallel until clinically detected."

We found a significant genetic heterogeneity between East Asian and European-descent populations at several blood pressure loci, conforming to “a common ancestry-specific variant association model”. At 6 unique loci, distinct non-rare (or common) ancestry-specific variants co-localized within the same linkage disequilibrium block despite the significantly discordant direction of effects for the proxy shared variants between the ethnic groups. The genome-wide transethnic correlation of causal-variant effect sizes is 0.898 and 0.851 for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively. Some of the ancestry-specific association signals were also influenced by a selective sweep. Our results provide new evidence for the role of common ancestry-specific variants and natural selection in the occurrence of ethnic differences in complex traits such as blood pressure."

EGAS00001002911,exploiting immune cell receptor   quantify  switching  single cell transcriptome sequencing experiment,"By offering high sequencing speed and ultra-high-throughput at a low price, Illumina next-generation sequencing platforms has been widely adopted in recent years. However, an experiment with multiplexed library could be at risk of molecular recombination, known as “index switching”, which causes certain amount of reads to be assigned to an incorrect library. It is reported that a new advance, exclusion amplification (ExAmp) in conjunction with the patterned flow cell technology introduced on HiSeq 3000/HiSeq 4000/HiSeq X sequencing systems, potentially suffers from a higher rate of index switching than conventional bridge amplification.  We took advantage of the diverse but highly cell-unique expression of immune cell receptors to quantify index switching on single cell RNA-seq data that were sequenced on HiSeq 3500 and HiSeq 4000. By utilizing the unique T-cell receptor (TCR) expression, we could quantify the spread-of-signal from many different wells (n=51 from total three batches) due to index switching. We used TraCer to reconstruct full-length TCR from all samples, and then used Kallisto to quantify TCR gene expression. We found index switching in all three batches of experiments investigated. The median percentage of incorrectly detected markers was estimated to be 4.2% (interquartile range (IQR): 2.0%-8.7%). We did not detect any consistent pattern of certain indices to be more prone for switching than others, suggesting that index switching is a stochastic process. We confirm that index switching is a problem that affects all samples run in multiplexed libraries on Illumina HiSeq 3500 and HiSeq 4000 platforms."

EGAS00001001457,genetic  epigenetic characterization  adenoid cystic carcinoma,"Translocation events are frequent in cancer and may create chimeric fusions or regulatory rearrangements that drive oncogene overexpression. Although regulatory rearrangements are increasingly recognized in hematopoietic and even solid tumors, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Here we identify super-enhancer translocations that drive overexpression of the oncogenic transcription factor MYB as a unifying theme in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). Whole genome sequencing data and chromatin state maps for 13 primary tumors and xenografts reveal distinct chromosomal rearrangements that juxtapose super-enhancer clusters to the MYB locus. Chromosome conformation capture confirms that the translocated enhancers physically interact with the MYB promoter. Remarkably, the MYB product itself binds to the translocated enhancers, thus creating a positive feedback loop that sustains its own expression. MYB also binds a large number of active enhancers that drive opposing regulatory programs in alternate cell lineages in ACC. MYB cooperates with the transcription factor TP63 in the myoepithelial component of the tumors, but promotes a Notch program in the luminal epithelial component. Bromodomain inhibitors, which disrupt enhancer function, slow tumor growth in ACC primagraft models in vivo, but are ineffective against high grade tumors that harbor activating mutations in the Notch pathway. Thus, our study identifies super-enhancer translocations as a unifying feature of ACC, and provides insight into the mechanism by which sustained MYB overexpression drives alternate cell fates in this disease.Processed ChIP-seq data is available on GEO under accession number GSE76465."

EGAS00001002700,genome wide dna methylation  predictive  outcome  juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia,"Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a myeloproliferative disorder of childhood caused by mutations in the Ras pathway. Outcomes in this disease vary dramatically from spontaneous resolution with little or no treatment to rapid relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Given the high morbidity and late effects of transplant, it is critical to identify patients at diagnosis who can be observed rather than transplanted. We hypothesized that assessing DNA methylation status would help predict disease outcome. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling using the Illumina 450k platform in a discovery cohort of 39 patients was performed. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on the most highly variable CpG sites identified three clusters of patients. Importantly, these clusters differed significantly in terms of 4-year event-free survival, with the lowest methylation cluster having the highest rates of survival. These findings were validated in an independent cohort of 40 patients. Of particular interest is that all but one of fourteen patients experiencing spontaneous resolution of their disease clustered together and closer to 22 healthy controls than the other JMML cases. This study demonstrates that DNA methylation patterns in JMML are predictive of outcome in this heterogeneously behaving disease and can identify patients who are most likely to experience spontaneous resolution."

EGAS00001000318, exome sequencing combined  functional genomics reveals novel candidate driver cancer genes  endometrial cancer,"Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological malignancy, with more than 280,000 cases occurring annually worldwide. Although previous studies have identified important common somatic mutations in endometrial cancer, they have primarily focused on a small set of known cancer genes and have thus provided a limited view of the molecular basis underlying this disease. Here we developed an integrated systems biology approach to identifying novel cancer genes contributing to endometrial tumorigenesis. We first performed whole-exome sequencing on 13 endometrial cancers and matched normal samples, systematically identifying somatic alterations with high precision and sensitivity. We then combined bioinformatics prioritization with high-throughput screening (including both shRNA-mediated knockdown and expression of wild type and mutant constructs) in a highly sensitive cell viability assay. Our results revealed 12 potential driver cancer genes including 10 tumor suppressor candidates (ARID1A, INHBA, KMO, TTLL5, GRM8, IGFBP3, AKTIP, PHKA2, TRPS1 and WNT11) and two oncogene candidates (ERBB3 and RPS6KC1). The results in the “sensor” cell line were recapitulated by siRNA-mediated knockdown in endometrial cancer cell lines. Focusing on ARID1A, we integrated mutation profiles with functional proteomics in 222 endometrial cancer samples, demonstrating that ARID1A mutations frequently co-occur with mutations in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and are associated with PI3K pathway activation. siRNA knockdown in endometrial cancer cell lines increased AKT phosphorylation supporting ARID1A as a novel regulator of PI3K pathway activity. Our study presents the first unbiased view of somatic coding mutations in endometrial cancer and provides functional evidence for diverse driver genes and mutations in this disease."
EGAS00001000323,identifying genetic consequences  epstein barr virus transformation  comparing  individual  genomic dna     lymphoblastoid cell ,"A detailed analysis of whole genomes can be now achieved with next generation sequencing. Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) transformation is a widely used strategy in clinical research to obtain an unlimited source of a subject’s DNA. Although the mechanism of transformation and immortalization by EBV is relatively well known at the transcriptional and proteomic level, the genetic consequences of EBV transformation are less well understood. A detailed analysis of the genetic alterations introduced by EBV transformation is highly relevant, as it will inform on the usefulness and limitations of this approach. We used whole genome sequencing to assess the genomic signature of a low-passage lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL). Specifically, we sequenced the full genome (40X) of an individual using DNA purified from fresh whole blood as well as DNA from his LCL. A total of 217.33 Gb of sequence were generated from the cell line and 238.95 Gb from the normal genomic DNA. We determined with high confidence that 99.2% of the genomes were identical, with no reproducible changes in structural variation (chromosomal rearrangements and copy number variations) or insertion/deletion polymorphisms (indels). Our results suggest that, at this level of resolution, the LCL is genetically indistinguishable from its genomic counterpart and therefore their use in clinical research is not likely to introduce a significant bias."

Applying an established clinical-translational pipeline for tissue collection and an automated microfluidic platform for CTC-enrichment, we generated 17 biopsy-derived PDXs and 17 CTC-derived PDXs in a two-year timeframe, at efficiencies of 89% and 38%, respectively. Whole exome sequencing showed that somatic alterations are stably maintained between patient tumors and PDXs. Early-passage PDXs maintain the genomic and transcriptional profiles of the founder PDX. In vivo treatment with etoposide and cisplatin (EP) in 30 PDX models demonstrated greater sensitivity in PDXs from EP naïve patients, and resistance to EP corresponded to increased expression of a MYC gene signature. Finally, serial CTC-derived PDXs generated from an individual patient at multiple time points accurately recapitulated the evolving drug sensitivities of that patient’s disease. Collectively, this work highlights the translational potential of this strategy."

Deeper insight into the history of Italian population is critical for understanding the peopling of Europe. Because of its crucial position at the centre of the Mediterranean basin, the Italian peninsula has experienced a complex history of colonization and migration, whose genetic signatures are still present in contemporary Italians. In this study, we investigated genomic variation in the Italian population using 2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a sample of more than 300 unrelated Italian subjects with well-defined geographical origins. We combined several analytical approaches to interpret genome-wide data on 1,272 individuals from European, Middle Eastern, and North African populations. We detected three major ancestral components contributing different proportions across the Italian peninsula, and signatures of continuous gene flow within Italy, which has produced remarkable genetic variability among contemporary Italians. In addition, we have extracted novel details about the Italian population’s ancestry: we identified genetic signatures of major historical events in Europe and the Mediterranean basin from the Neolithic (e.g., peopling of Sardinia) to recent times (e.g., ‘barbarian invasion’ of Northern and Central Italy). These results are valuable for further genetic, epidemiological and forensic studies in Italy and in Europe."

About 5% of colorectal adenomas are estimated to progress to CRC. However, it is important to identify which adenomas actually carry a high-risk of progression, because these serve as intermediate endpoints for e.g. screening programs. In clinical practice, adenomas with a size of ≥10 mm, villous component and/or high-grade dysplasia, called advanced adenomas, are considered high-risk, although solid evidence for this classification is lacking. Specific DNA copy number changes are associated with adenoma-to-carcinoma progression.For this tissue dataset, we applied low-pass whole genome sequencing to 96 advanced adenomas. Advanced adenomas were classified as lesions with low-risk or high-risk of progression, according to the presence of specific DNA copy number changes (Carvalho et al, CancerPrevRes, 2018)."

As neuroblastoma is expected to have high degree of genetic heterogeneity, study of neuroblastoma's clonal evolution with deep coverage whole-genome sequencing of diagnosis and relapse samples will lead to a better understanding of the molecular events associated with relapse.  Samples were included in this study if sufficient DNA from constitutional, diagnosis and relapse tumors was available for WGS.  Whole genome sequencing was performed on trios (constitutional, diagnose and relapse DNA) from eight patients using Illumina Hi-seq2500 leading to paired-ends (PE) 90x90 for 6 of them and 100x100 for two. Expected coverage for sample NB0175 100x100bp was 30X for tumor and constitutional samples. For the seven other patients expected coverage was 80X for tumor samples with PE 100x100, 100X in the other tumor samples and 50X for all constitutional samples (see table 1). Following alignment with BWA (Li et al., Oxford J, 2009 Jul) allowing up to 4% of mismatches, bam files were cleaned up according to the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) recommendations (Van der Auwera et al., Current Protocols in Bioinformatics, 2013, picard-1.45, GenomeAnalysisTK-2.2-16).   Variant calling was performed in parallel using 3 variant callers: GenomeAnalysisTK-2.2-16, Samtools-0.1.18 and MuTect-1.1.4 (McKenna et al., Genome Res, 2010; Li et al., Oxford J, 2009 Aug; Cibulskis et al., Nature, 2013). Annovar-v2012-10-23 with cosmic-v64 and dbsnp-v137 were used for the annotation and RefSeq for the structural annotation. For GATK and Samtools,  single nucleotide variants (SNVs) with a quality under 30, a depth of coverage under 6 or with less than 2 reads supporting the variant were filter out. MuTect with parameters following GATK and Samtools thresholds have been used to filter our irrelevant variants. .SNVs within and around exons of coding genes overlapping splice sites.. Then,variants reported in more than 1% of the population in the 1000 genomes (1000gAprl_2012) or Exome Sequencing Project (ESP6500) have been discarded in order to filter polymorphisms. Finally, synonymous variants were filtered out. MuTect focuses on somatic by filtering with constitutional sample. Mpileup comparison between constitutional and somatic DNAs  allowed us to focus also on tumor specific SNVs with GATK and Samtools. Finally, every SNV called by our pipeline and also supported in any constitutional samples were filtered our in order to prevent putative constitutional DNA coverage deficiency.   Then we analyzed CNVs (copy number variants) with HMMcopy-v0.1.1 (Gavin et al., Genome Res, 2012) and control-FREEC-v6.7 (Boeva et al., Bioinformatics 2011) with a respective window of 2000bp and 1000 bp, and auto-correction of normal contamination of tumor samples for Control-FREEC.  Finally we explored Structural variants (SVs) including deletions, inversions, tandem duplications and translocations using DELLY-v0.5.5 with standard parameters (Rausch et al., Oxford J, 2012). In tumors, at least 10 supporting reads were required to make a call and 5 supporting reads for the sample NB0175 with a coverage of only 40X (see table 2). To predict SVs in constitutional samples for subsequent somatic filtering, only 2 supporting reads were required in order not to miss one. To identify somatic events, all the SVs in each normal sample were first flanked by 500 bp in both directions and any SVs called in a tumor sample which was in the combined flanked regions of respective normal sample was removed (see graph 1). Deletions with more than 5 genes impacted or larger than 1Mb and inversions or tandem duplications covering more than 4 genes, were removed. We focused on exonic and splicing events for deletions, inversions, and tandem duplications. For translocation, we keep all SVs that occurred in intronic, exonic, 5'UTR, upstream or splicing regions.  Bioinformatics detection of variations with Deep sequencing approach Once PE reads merged and adaptors trimmed by SeqPrep with default parameters, merged reads were aligned via the BWA (Li H. and Durbin R. 2009 PMID 19451168) allowing up to 1 differences in the 22-base-long seeds and reporting only unique alignments. Only reads having a mapping quality 20 or more have been further analysed. Variant calling software was not used, since we aimed to predict variations at low frequencies, observed in less than 1% of reads. Such variants require a custom approach. Using DepthOfCoverage functions of the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) v2.13.2 (McKenna A, et al., 2010 Genome Research PMID: 20644199), we focused on high quality coverage of bases A, C, G and T at the targeted variant position. Depth of coverage of each base following a mapping quality higher than 20 and a base quality higher than 10 have been taken into account in order to focus only on high quality data. Aiming to determine the background level of variability at the studied regions, 10 control samples were included in the analysis. The same approach and filtering criteria have been applied as introduced above over the entire amplicons.  In order to highlight variants, for each sample the frequencies of each bases at each amplicon position were then compared to those observed in the set of controls. Statistical analyses were performed with the R statistical software (http://www.R-project.org). Fisher’s exact two-sided tests with a Bonferroni correction were performed to compare percentages of bases between the data sets, i.e. for a given base between a case and the controls. Finally, significant variations were filtered-in once (i) a significant increase in the percentage of avariant base and (ii) a significant decrease in the percentage of it's reference base following our p.values criteria was observed (p.val &lt; 0.05)."

The mechanisms underlying LMS development, including clinically actionable genetic vulnerabilities, are largely unknown. We performed genomic and transcriptomic profiling of a large cohort of LMS tumors and identified substantial mutational heterogeneity, near-universal inactivation of TP53 and RB1, widespread DNA copy number alterations, chromothripsis, and frequent whole-genome duplication. Furthermore, we discovered recurrent alterations in telomere maintenance genes such as ATRX, RBL2, and RPA1, resulting in alternative lengthening of telomeres in 78% of cases. Finally, most tumors displayed hallmarks of “BRCAness”, including alterations in various homologous recombination DNA repair genes, multiple structural rearrangements, and enrichment of specific mutational signatures, and cultured LMS cells were sensitive towards olaparib and cisplatin treatment. This first comprehensive study of genetic alterations in LMS has uncovered key biological features that may inform future experimental research and enable the design of novel therapeutic strategies for this disease."

A well-recognized complication of FL is its transformation to a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)-morphology in a subset of patients, for which the clinical outcomes are poor. Recent genetic profiling and single case studies of donor-derived FL following stem cell transplantation had alluded to the putative existence of a ‘long lived’ tumor-initiating progenitor cell compartment from which successive disease events occurred. To chronicle the genetic changes associated with progression to transformation, we conducted whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of FL-tFL pairs and matched germline (GL) samples from six patients, a total of 20 genomes."

EGAS00001000451,plasma seq  patients  metastatic prostate cancer,"Study 1 In this study we analysed patients with metastatic prostate cancer to scan their tumor genomes noninvasively in plasma DNA. We wanted to make whole-genome analysis from plasma DNA amenable to clinical routine applications and developed an approach based on a benchtop high-throughput platform, i.e. Illuminas MiSeq instrument. We performed whole-genome sequencing from plasma at a shallow sequencing depth to establish a genome-wide copy number profile of the tumor at low costs within 2 days. The genome-wide profiling in the plasma of our patients revealed multiple copy number aberrations including those previously reported in prostate tumors, such as losses in 8p and gains in 8q. High-level copy number gains in the AR locus were observed in patients with CRPC but not with CSPC disease. We identified the TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement associated 3-Mbp deletion on chromosome 21 and found corresponding fusion plasma fragments in these cases. In an index case multiregional sequencing of the primary tumor identified different copy number changes in each sector, suggesting multifocal disease. Our plasma analyses of this index case, performed 13 years after resection of the primary tumor, revealed novel chromosomal rearrangements, which were stable in serial plasma analyses over a 9 months period, which is consistent with the presence of one metastatic clone.  Our approach provides specific genomic signatures within 2 days which may therefore serve as “liquid biopsy”."

In addition, monitoring treatment and early detection of fatal breast cancer (BC) remains a major unmet need. Aberrant methylation patterns of linked CpGs analyzed in DNA fragments shed by cancers into the bloodstream (i.e. cell-free DNA) can provide highly specific signals indicating cancer presence.In order to discover the most relevant CpG regions, we used RRBS and analysed several tissue samples: 11 prospectively collected invasive epithelial ovarian cancer samples (high grade serous n=8, low grade serous n=1, endometrioid n=1, mucinous n=1, mean age = 54.7 years), 8 prospectively collected invasive ductal breast cancer samples (2/8 triple negative; mean age = 56.6 years), one benign tumor (papillary serous cystadenoma, age = 86 years), 18 non-neoplastic tissue samples (breast n=7 and adnexal n=11, mean age = 60.2 years), two non-neoplastic endometrial tissues (mean age = 68 years) and twenty three white blood cell samples (mean age = 57.8 years) were assessed by RRBS. Genome wide methylation analysis was performed by Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) at GATC Biotech. DNA was digested with MspI followed by size selection of the library, providing enhanced coverage for the CpG-rich regions. The digested DNA was adapter ligated, bisulfite modified and PCR amplified. The libraries were sequenced on Illumina’s HiSeq 2500. Analysis of the first samples sequenced with 100bp paired-end mode showed that the library insert size was small. Therefore, the remaining samples were sequenced with 50 bp paired-end mode. Using Genedata Expressionist® for Genomic Profiling v9.1, we established a bioinformatics pipeline for the detection of cancer specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs). The most promising DMRs were taken forward for the development and validation of serum based clinical assays."

One of the best characterized subtypes of AML involves leukemias with alterations of the core-binding factor (CBF)-complex, which comprises the FAB subtypes M2 and M4Eo and associates with a favorable outcome. Patients with the AML M2 subtype harbor a translocation between chromosomes 8 and 21 [t(8;21)] that yields the chimeric fusion gene RUNX1(AML1)-RUNX1T1(ETO), while patients with AML M4Eo express the chimeric fusion gene CBFβ-SMMHC(MYH11) as a result of an inversion/translocation event of chromosome 16 [inv(16)/t(16;16)]. In an effort to define the total complement of genetic changes in CBF-leukemia, we performed paired-end whole genome sequencing (WGS) on diagnostic leukemia blasts and matched germ line samples from 17 pediatric CBF-leukemia patients using the Illumina platform. Somatic alterations, including single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and structural variations (SVs), including insertions, deletions, inversions, and inter- and intra-chromosomal rearrangements, were detected using complementary analysis pipelines (Bambino, CREST and CONSERTING).

Our studies will focus primarily on cardiovascular-related quantitative traits, obesity and related metabolic traits, neurodevelopmental disorders and a limited number of extreme clinical phenotypes that will provide proof-of-concept for future familial trait sequencing.  We will analyse directly quantitative traits in the cohorts and the selected traits in the extreme samples, and also use imputation down to 0.1% allele frequency to extend the analyses to further sample sets with genome wide genotype data. In each case we will investigate indels and larger structural variants as well as SNPs, and use statistical methods that combine rare variants in a locus or pathway as well as single-variant approaches. 
The Ciliopathies samples will be part of the rare disease group, and will undergo exome sequencing. For further information with regard to this cohort please contact Phil Beales (p.beales@ich.ucl.ac.uk)."
EGAS00001002979,targeted sequencing  head  neck squamous cell carcinomas,"Overall survival remains very poor for patients diagnosed with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Identification of additional biomarkers and novel therapeutic strategies are important for improving patient outcome. Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), generated by implanting fresh tumor tissue directly from patients into immune-deficient mice, recapitulate many of the features of their corresponding clinical cancers, including histopathological and molecular profiles. Using a large collection of PDX models of HNSCC we demonstrate that rapid engraftment into immune-compromised mice is highly prognostic, and show that genomic deregulation of the G1/S checkpoint pathway correlates with engraftment. Furthermore, CCND1 and CDKN2A genomic alterations are predictive of response to the CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib. Overall, our study supports the pursuit of CDK4/6 inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for a substantial proportion of HNSCC patients, and demonstrates the potential of using PDX models to identify novel targeted therapies for those patients who have the poorest outcomes."

The etiology of this syndrome has been an enigma since the initial description in 1880 by von Graaefe and in 1888 by Möbius, and it has been debated for decades whether MBS has a genetic or a non-genetic etiology. Here, we reveal various de novo mutations affecting two genes, PLXND1 and REV3L. The finding that de novo mutations can cause Möbius syndrome will have considerable impact on further research, as well as in diagnostics. PLXND1 and REV3L represent totally unrelated pathways involved in hindbrain development: neural migration and DNA translesion synthesis, essential for the replication of endogenously damaged DNA. However, analysis of Plxnd1 and Rev3l-mutant mice revealed that both genetic defects converge at the facial branchiomotor nucleus, affecting either motoneuron migration or proliferation."
EGAS00001003001,spatial transcriptomics  prostate cancer heterogeneity,"Intratumor heterogeneity is one of the biggest challenges in cancer treatment today. Here we investigate tissue-wide gene expression heterogeneity throughout a multifocal prostate cancer using the spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology. Utilizing a novel approach for deconvolution, we analyze the transcriptomes of nearly 6750 tissue regions and extract distinct expression profiles for the different tissue components, such as stroma, normal and PIN glands, immune cells and cancer. We distinguish healthy and diseased areas and thereby provide insight into gene expression changes during the progression of prostate cancer. Compared to pathologist annotations, we delineate the extent of cancer foci more accurately, interestingly without link to histological changes. We identify gene expression gradients in stroma adjacent to tumor regions that allow for re-stratification of the tumor microenvironment. The establishment of these profiles is the first step towards an unbiased view of prostate cancer and can serve as a dictionary for future studies."
EGAS00001003007,biallelic tumor suppressor loss  dna repair defects  de novo small cell prostate cancer,"Small cell prostatic carcinoma (SCPC) is an aggressive pathology that is managed similar to small cell lung cancer. SCPC can evolve from prostatic adenocarcinoma in response to androgen deprivation therapy but in rare cases is present at initial cancer diagnosis. The molecular etiology of de novo SCPC is incompletely understood due to the scarcity of tumor tissue and the brief life expectancy of patients. Through a retrospective search of our regional oncology pharmacy database, we identified 18 patients diagnosed with de novo SCPC between 2004 and 2017. Ten patients had pure SCPC pathology and the remainder had some admixed adenocarcinoma foci, but all were treated with first line platinum-based chemotherapy. Median overall survival was 28 months. We performed targeted DNA sequencing, whole exome sequencing and mRNA profiling on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded archival tumor tissue. We observed frequent biallelic deletion and/or mutation of tumor suppressors TP53, RB1 and PTEN, similar to treatment related SCPC. Indeed, at the RNA level pure de novo SCPC closely resembled treatment-related SCPC. However, five patients had biallelic loss of DNA repair genes including BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM and MSH2/6: potentially underlying the high genomic instability of this rare disease variant. Two patients with pure de novo SCPC harbored ETS gene rearrangements to androgen-driven promoters, consistent with evolution of de novo SCPC from an androgen-driven ancestor. Overall, our results reveal a highly aggressive molecular landscape underlies this unusual pathologic variant, and propose opportunities for targeted therapy strategies in a disease with few treatment options."

EGAS00001000584,assessing  impact  low frequency coding variants  disease risk   exomechip,"Following several rounds of Genome Wide Association (GWA) scans and subsequent meta-analyses of results multiple risk loci have been identified for many common diseases. However, in most instances the implicated common variants identified so far explain only a modest fraction of the genetic risk. In parallel to our efforts to identify the causative variants in the known loci it is necessary to assess the full spectrum of sequence variants for disease risk and in particular low frequency and rare variants that have not been tested in a comprehensive way so far. To this end an international effort by investigators who have performed whole exome sequencing in circa 12,000 individuals have assembled a set of ~250,000 exonic variants of low frequency – defined as seen in at least two studies and a minimum of three individuals (non-sysnonymous) or two individuals for SNPs altering splice sites / stop codons. The SNP content from the exome studies was complemented with additional interesting SNP sets totalling 25,000 markers (GWA tag SNPs, grid of common variants, HLA, Mitochondrial, Y-chromosome etc) and were used to generate a custom iSELECT array, the exome chip. Adequately powered association studies to test low frequency variants for association to disease risk are still very expensive if conducted by whole exome sequencing. The exome chip provides a cost efficient way to undertake such an experiment and the Wellcome Trust Cases Control Consortium will be applying this approach to eight diseases, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, bipolar, and ankylosing spondylitis. The first objective will be to generate a large set of at least 10,000 common UK controls as analysis of lower frequency variants will require large sample sizes.

EGAS00001000605,genome wide snp genotyping  central african rainforest hunter gatherers  neighbouring agriculturalists,"The emergence of agriculture in West-Central Africa, ~5,000 years ago, profoundly modified the cultural landscape and mode of subsistence of most sub-Saharan populations. How this major innovation has impacted the genetic history of rainforest hunter-gatherers — historically referred to as “pygmies” — and agriculturalists, however, remains poorly understood. Here, we report genome-wide SNP data from eight of these populations located west-to-east of the equatorial rainforest. We find that hunter-gathering populations present up to 50% of farmer genomic ancestry, and that substantial admixture began only within the last 1,000 years. Furthermore, we show that the historical population sizes characterising these communities already differed before the introduction of agriculture. Our results suggest that the first socio-economic interactions between rainforest hunter-gatherers and farmers introduced by the spread of farming were not accompanied by immediate, extensive genetic exchanges and occurred on a backdrop of two groups already differentiated by their specialisation in two ecotopes with differing carrying capacities."
EGAS00001000622,pharmacological  genomic profiling identifies nf  targeted treatment strategies  mantle cell lymphoma,"Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive malignancy characterized by poor prognosis, underscoring the need for novel therapeutic strategies1. In this study, we employed large-scale pharmacological profiling of 16 pathway inhibitors across more than 100 hematological cell line models to identify novel therapeutic approaches. This screen identified a subset of MCL cell lines that were highly sensitive to the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling inhibitors ibrutinib and sotrastaurin (STN), which are currently in clinical trials2, 3. Sensitive MCL models exhibited chronic activation of the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex and dependency on downstream classical NFκB signaling. In contrast, insensitive cell lines displayed activation of the alternative NFκB pathway. Massively parallel transcriptome sequencing identified mutations in negative regulators of the alternative NFκB pathway in ibrutinib-insensitive cell lines. Notably, sequencing of 165 MCL patient samples  revealed that components of the alternative NFκB pathway, particularly TRAF2 and BIRC3, are mutated in roughly 15% of MCL patients. Functional analyses of patient-derived BIRC3 mutant alleles indicated that these are loss-of-function mutants that constitutively activate alternative NFκB signaling. While being associated with insensitivity to ibrutinib, genetic lesions in the alternative pathway conferred dependence on NIK, a kinase that mediates signaling downstream of the TRAF2/3-BIRC2/3 complex. Thus, NIK represents a novel therapeutic target for MCL treatment, particularly for tumors refractory to BCR pathway inhibitors. Collectively, these findings reveal a pattern of mutually exclusive activation of the CBM-NFκB or alternative NIK-NFκB pathways in MCL and provide critical insights into patient stratification strategies for NFκB-pathway targeted agents."

EGAS00001000407,characterization  individual foci  multicentric multifocal breast cancer  targeted  generation sequencing,"Multifocality or multicentricity in breast cancer may be defined as the presence of two or more tumor foci within a single quadrant of the breast or within different quadrants of the same breast, respectively. This original classification of the breast cancer as multicentric or multifocal was based on the assumption that cancers arising in the same quadrant were more likely to arise from the same ductal structures than those occurring in separate areas of the breast. The problem with these definitions is that the “quadrants” of the breast are arbitrary external designations, as no internal boundaries do exist. This project will therefore focus both on synchronous multifocal and multicentric tumors. The incidence of multifocal and multicentric breast cancers was reported to be between 13 and 75% depending on the definition used, the extent of the pathologic sampling of the breast and whether in situ disease is considered evidence of multicentricity (1). Although this incidence is variable, those figures show that it is a frequent phenomenon. Multiple (multifocal/multicentric) breast carcinomas, especially when occurring in the same breast, represent a real challenge for both pathologists and clinicians in terms of identifying the cellular origin and the best therapeutic management of the cancer. Multifocality or multicentricity has been associated with a number of more aggressive features including an increased rate of regional lymph node metastases and adverse patient outcome when compared with unifocal tumors (2-3), and a possible increased risk of local recurrence following breast conserving surgery (4). For the moment, the literature is divided on whether there is a corresponding impact on survival outcomes. Today, the current convention to stage and to treat multifocal and multicentric tumors is the classical tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging guidelines with which tumor size is assessed by the largest tumor focus without taking other foci of disease into consideration. If some papers, as the recent one from Lynch and colleagues, support the current staging convention (3), others, however, as Boyages et al. suggested that aggregate size and not the size of the largest lesion should be considered in order to refine the prognostic assessment of those tumors (5). On the top of that, the question whether multifocal/multicentric carcinomas are due to the spread of a single carcinoma throughout the breast or is due to multiple carcinomas arising simultaneously has been a matter of debate. Some studies suggested that multifocal breast cancer may result from either intramammary spread from a single primary tumor or multiple synchronous primary tumors; whereas others suggest that multiple breast carcinomas always arise from the same clone (6-8). Recently, Pietri and colleagues analyzed the biological characterization of a series of 113 multifocal/multicentric breast cancers (8) which were diagnosed over a 5-year period. The expression of estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PgR) receptors, Ki-67 proliferative index, expression of HER2 and tumor grading were prospectively determined in each tumor focus, and mismatches among foci were recorded. Mismatches in ER status were present in 5 (4.4%) cases and PgR in 18 (15.9%) cases. Mismatches in tumor grading were present in 21 cases (18.6%), proliferative index (Ki-67) in 17 (15%) cases and HER2 status in 11 (9.7%) cases. Interestingly, this heterogeneity among foci has led to 14 (12.4%) patients receiving different adjuvant treatments compared with what would have been indicated if we had only taken into account the biologic status of the primary tumor. This study therefore showed that differences in biological characteristics of multifocal/multicentric lesions play a crucial role in the adjuvant treatment decision making process. In this study, we will concentrate on a larger series of patients with multifocal invasive ductal breast cancer lesions. We aim at: 1. Evaluating the incidence of multifocality according to the different breast cancer molecular subtypes (ER-/HER2-, HER2+, ER+/HER2-). 2. Evaluating the incidence of multifocality in patients with hereditary breast cancer disease (presence of germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations). Moreover, we would like to investigate if multifocal lesions with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations exhibit a characteristic combination of substitution mutation signatures and a distinctive profile of deletions as demonstrated recently by Nik-Zainal and colleagues (9). 3. Correlating multifocality with clinical information in order to define its influence on patients’ survival (DFS and OS). 4. Carrying high coverage targeted gene sequencing of driver cancer genes and genes whose mutation is of therapeutic importance in order to compare clinically-relevant genetic differences between several multifocal breast cancer lesions. 5. Evaluating the impact of the distance between the different lesions on the clinical outcome but also on the genetic differences. 6. Comparing gene expression patterns between several multifocal breast cancer lesions and correlate them with the results of the targeted genes screen. 7. Characterizing the genomic and transcriptomic status of cancer related genes in metastatic lesions (local recurrence, positive lymph node or distant metastatic sites) from the same multifocal invasive ductal breast cancer patients in order to evaluate the consequence of genomic and transcriptomic heterogeneity of multifocal lesions on metastatic lesions. Multiple (multifocal/multicentric) breast carcinomas, especially when occurring in the same breast, represent a real challenge for both pathologists and clinicians in terms of identifying the cellular origin and the best therapeutic choice. This project has the potential to identify genetic/transcriptomic differences existing between several lesions constituting multifocal breast cancers, which in the routine clinical practice are usually considered to be homogeneous among them. We foresee validating significant results in a larger series of patients and this, in turn, could have a remarkable impact on the treatment and clinical management of multifocal breast cancers. Indeed, we hope to provide some evidence whether or not each focus matters in multifocal and multicentric breast cancer to define the adequate therapeutic approach, especially in the context of targeted therapies. The work to be done at Sanger will be target gene screen pooling of 1400 samples."

EGAS00001000673,exploration  cnv   snv   cancers  well  genetic rearrangements identification  additional genetic changes  rearrangements driven cancer,"Specific cancers are well known to have specific gene rearrangements. Representative cancer is chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) which is famous for BCR/ABL gene rearrangements. By the way, also genetic rearrangements are not infrequently found in acute leukemia, and those include CBFB/MYH11 rearrangements, PML/RARA rearrangements, AML/ETO rearrangements, and BCR/ABL rearrangements. The situation is same is for lung adenocarcinoma of non-smokers and prostate cancers, and ALK and RET gene rearrangements are recently found. However, not all these rearrangements are sufficient to develop cancer, and it is suggested that some genetic aberrations are required for the development and progression of cancer in addition to these genetic rearrangements.   In this study, we have a plan to explore the existence of additional genetic changes including single nucleotide variants (SNV’s) and copy number variations (CNV’s) in cancers with specific genetic rearrangements so as to define additional genetic changes that confer full oncogenic potential to cancer cells.  So as to look at SNV’s and small indels, we are going to use whole exome sequencing (WES) data. And as for CNV’s, we are going to use array-CGH data. Also, to check the functionality of these genetic changes, we are going to use whole transcriptome data (WTS). In addition, in samples with whole genome sequencing (WGS ) data, we are going  to explore genetic changes in intronic regions also.  In fact, we sequenced 10 AML samples which are known to have specific genetic rearrangements. Analysis of these WGS, WES and WTS data are under the way. If we have a chance to access WES, array-CGH and WTS data of other cancer samples with specific genetic rearrangements, we would be able to compare additional genetic changes required for oncogenesis in cancer cells with various genetic rearrangements. We hope this result will enlighten our understanding of cancer genetics further."

Here, exome sequencing identified novel recurrent somatic FRK mutations that induce constitutive kinase activity, STAT3 activation and cell proliferation sensitive to Src inhibitors. We also found new recurrent mutations activating JAK1, gp130 or ß-catenin. Chromosome copy-number and methylation profiling revealed patterns that correlated with specific gene mutations and tumor phenotypes. Finally, integrative analysis of HCA transformed to hepatocellular carcinoma revealed ß-catenin mutation as an early alteration and TERT promoter mutations as associated with the last step of the adenoma-carcinoma transition. In conclusion, we identified the genomic diversity in benign hepatocyte proliferation, new therapeutic targets and the key genomic determinants of the adenoma-carcinoma transformation sequence.  Significance: Malignant transformation of benign adenoma into malignant carcinoma is frequently observed in several epithelial tumor types. Adenoma-carcinoma transition is crucial for the patient prognosis, however, little is known on the molecular mechanisms involved. Here, we performed an integrated genomic analysis of hepatocellular adenomas (HCA). Among several novel gene mutations, we identified recurrent somatic mutation activating FRK, a Src-like kinase. FRK activating mutations induce STAT3 activation and cell proliferation that can be targeted by Src inhibitors. Focusing on malignant transformation of HCA in hepatocellular carcinoma, we identified CTNNB1 and TERT promoter mutation as early and late genomic events involved in adenoma-carcinoma transition. In conclusion, we propose new therapeutic targets and an identification of adenomas with the highest risk of malignant transformation.   Highlights: - FRK is activated by somatic recurrent mutations. - FRK mutants promote cell proliferation sensitive to src inhibitors. - CTNNB1 activation is an early event in HCA transformation. - TERT promoter mutations are associated with adenoma-carcinoma transition."

EGAS00001000908,evolution   african pygmy phenotype,"The evolutionary history of the human ‘pygmy’ phenotype (small body size), a characteristic of African and Southeast Asian rainforest hunter-gatherers, is largely unknown. Here we use a genome-wide admixture mapping analysis to identify 16 genomic regions that are significantly associated with the pygmy phenotype in the Batwa, a rainforest hunter-gatherer population from Uganda (East Central Africa). The identified genomic regions have multiple attributes that provide supporting evidence of genuine association with the pygmy phenotype, including enrichments for SNPs previously associated with stature variation in Europeans and for genes with growth hormone receptor and regulation functions. To test adaptive evolutionary hypotheses we computed the haplotype-based iHS statistic and the level of population differentiation (FST) between the Batwa and their agricultural neighbors, the Bakiga, for each SNP. Both |iHS| and FST values were significantly higher for SNPs within the Batwa pygmy phenotype-associated regions than the remainder of the genome, a signature of polygenic adaptation. In contrast, when we expanded our analysis to include Baka rainforest hunter-gatherers from Cameroon and Gabon (West Central Africa) and Nzebi and Nzime neighboring agriculturalists, we did not observe elevated |iHS| or FST values in these genomic regions. Together, these results suggest adaptive and at least partially convergent origins of the pygmy phenotype even within Africa, supporting the hypothesis that small body size confers a selective advantage for tropical rainforest hunter-gatherers but raising questions about the antiquity of this behavior."

However, reliable genetic profiling of archived clinical specimens has been hindered by limited sensitivity and high false positive rates. Here, we describe a novel methodology, MMP-seq, which enables sensitive and specific high-throughput, high content genetic profiling in archived clinical samples.  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We first validated MMP-seq’s technical performance in 66 cancer cell lines and a Latin square cross-dilution of known somatic mutations. We next characterized the performance of MMP-seq in 17 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) clinical samples using matched fresh frozen (FF) tissue from the same tumors as benchmarks. To demonstrate the potential clinical utility of our methodology, we profiled FFPE tumor samples from 73 endometrial cancer patients.  RESULTS: We demonstrated that MMP-seq enabled rapid and simultaneous profiling of a panel of 88 cancer genes in 48 samples, and detected variants at frequencies as low as 0.4%. We identified DNA degradation and deamination as the main error sources and developed practical and robust strategies for mitigating these issues, and dramatically reduced the false positive rate. Applying MMP-seq to a cohort of endometrial tumor samples identified extensive, potentially actionable alterations in the PI3K and RAS pathways, including novel PIK3R1 hotspot mutations that may disrupt negative regulation of PIK3CA.  CONCLUSIONS: MMP-seq provides a robust solution for comprehensive, reliable and high- throughput genetic profiling of clinical tumor samples, paving the way for the incorporation of genomic-based testing into clinical investigation and practice."

They are classified histologically into low- and high-grade tumours, with morphologically low-grade tumours thought to behave more favourably. However, limited information is available, with only 18 published cases.
•	We have collected morphologically low-grade spiroadenocarcinomas (one with a lung metastasis) and high-grade spiroadenocarcinomas, as well as some spiradenomas (benign lesions),  cylindromas (another type of malignant cutaneous sweat gland adnexal tumour) and hybrid spiradenoma-cylindromas.
•	H&amp;E-stained sections were reviewed, follow-up was obtained, and immunohistochemistry for Ki-67, p53 and, MYB has been performed. The tumours were solitary, measuring 0.8-7?cm (median: 2.7?cm), with a predilection for the head and neck of elderly patients (median age: 72 years; range 53-92) without gender bias. Histologically, the tumours were multinodular and located in deep dermis and subcutis. A pre-existing spiradenoma was present in all cases. The malignant component was characterized by expansile growth with loss of the dual cell population, up to moderate cytological atypia and increased mitotic activity (median: 10/10 HPF; range 1-28). Additional findings included squamoid differentiation (n=9), necrosis (n=7), and ulceration (n=5). P53 expression was variable and no significant differences were noted in the benign compared with the malignant parts of the tumours. In contrast, in the malignant components the Ki-67 proliferative index was slightly increased, and MYB expression was lost. Follow-up (median: 67 months; range: 13-132) available for 16 patients (84%) revealed a local recurrence rate of 19% but no metastases or disease-related mortality.

The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, and 40 newer regions identified by genome wide association studies (GWAS) and dense fine mapping, account for ~40% of the disease heritability. We hypothesized that in pedigrees with multiple individuals with coeliac disease rare [minor allele frequency (MAF)  &lt;0.5%] mutations of larger effect size (odds ratios of ~ 2 – 5) might exist. We sequenced the exomes of 75 coeliac individuals of European ancestry from 55 multiply affected families. We selected interesting variants and genes for further follow up using a combination of: an assessment of shared variants between related subjects, a model-free linkage test, and gene burden tests for multiple, potentially causal, variants. We next performed highly multiplexed amplicon resequencing of all RefSeq exons from 24 candidate genes selected on the basis of the exome sequencing data in 2,248 unrelated coeliac cases and 2,230 controls. 1,335 variants with a 99.9% genotyping call rate were observed in 4,478 samples, of which 939 were present in coding regions of 24 genes (Ti/Tv 2.99). 91.7% of coding variants were rare (MAF &lt;0.5%) and 60% were novel.

EGAS00001003043,evolutionary dynamics  residual disease  human glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive adult brain malignancy against which conventional surgery and chemoradiation provide limited benefit. Even when a good treatment response is obtained, recurrence inevitably occurs either locally (c.80%) or distally (c.20%), driven by cancer clones that are often genomically distinct from those in the primary tumour. Glioblastoma cells display a characteristic infiltrative phenotype, invading the surrounding tissue and often spreading across the whole brain. We hypothesised that cancer cells responsible for relapse reside in two compartments of residual disease that are left behind after treatment: the infiltrated normal brain parenchyma, and the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ). In this model, residual disease subclones diverge early during glioblastoma evolution, may remain dormant in the normal parenchyma and are responsible for recurrence. To test our hypothesis, we performed whole-exome sequencing of 69 multi- region samples collected using fluorescence-guided resection from 11 patients, including the infiltrating tumour margin (M) and the SVZ for each patient, as well as matched blood. We used a phylogenomic approach to dissect the spatio-temporal evolution of each tumour and unveil the relation between residual disease and the main tumour mass. We also analysed two patients with paired primary-recurrence samples with matched residual disease. Our results suggest that the infiltrative phenotype is an early evolutionary trait of glioblastoma, giving rise to the tumour mass detected at surgery. After treatment, the same infiltrative clone may seed the growth of a recurrent tumour, thus representing the ‘missing link’ between the primary tumour and recurrent disease. These results are consistent with recognised clinical phenotypic behaviour and suggest that more specific therapeutic targeting of cells in the infiltrated brain parenchyma may improve patient’s outcome."
EGAS00001003119,low  variable tumor reactivity   intratumoral tcr repertoire  human cancers,"Infiltration of human cancers by T cells is generally interpreted as a sign of immune recognition, and there is a growing effort to reactivate dysfunctional T cells at such tumor sites. However, these efforts only have value if the intratumoral T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of such cells is intrinsically tumor-reactive, and this has not been established in an unbiased manner for most human cancers. To address this issue, we analyzed the intrinsic tumor-reactivity of the intratumoral TCR repertoire of CD8+ T cells in ovarian and colorectal cancer – two tumor types for which T cell infiltrates form a positive prognostic marker. Data obtained demonstrate that a capacity to recognize autologous tumor is limited to approximately 10% of intratumoral CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, in two out of four patient samples tested, no tumor-reactive TCRs were identified, despite infiltration of their tumors by T cells. These data indicate that the intrinsic capacity of intratumoral T cells to recognize adjacent tumor tissue can be rare and variable, and suggest that clinical efforts to reactivate intratumoral T cells will benefit from approaches that simultaneously increase the quality of the intratumoral TCR repertoire."

In order to understand why normal cells become cancer cells and how we can identify and destroy them, the CTMM-NGS-ProToCol project aimed to understand prostate and colorectal cancer through DNA and RNA molecular profiling, to further improve diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.The state-of-the-art within the field of genome sequencing makes it possible to identify all the modifications in our genome that encode for RNA and of the transcripts themselves. The latest development in RNA sequencing is that if one does not select for polyA RNA, but first removes rRNA from the total RNA and then performs ‘random’ RNA sequencing, 30-60% of the reads are intronic. Since about 40% of the genome consists of genes (and only 1.6% is exonic), deep RNA sequencing will cover not only the exons, but also a large portion of the introns and therefore much of the genome. The power of the combined sequencing of genome and transcriptome is the full view of copy number aberrations (CNA), exon mutations and the consequence and relevance of the mutations at the RNA level in the form of differential gene expression, alternative splicing, alternative promoter usage, novel transcripts, fusion transcripts, read-through transcripts and mutations.

EGAS00001000839,targeting  dna repair pathway  ewing sarcoma,"Ewing’s Sarcoma is a bone and soft tissue tumor that primarily affects adolescents and young adults. With current therapies, 70% of patients with localized disease survive but survival for metastatic and recurrent disease is poor. Whole genome sequencing of 19 Ewing’s Sarcoma tumors showed that STAG2 was mutated in 10% (2/19) of the tumors and STAG2 protein was absent in 14% (13/106) tumors by immunohistochemical staining. Previous studies have shown that glioblastoma cells lacking STAG2 are more sensitive to poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. We found that Ewing’s Sarcoma cell lines are sensitive to PARP inhibitors irrespective of STAG2 protein expression. Ewing Sarcoma cell lines are defective in double strand DNA break repair. PARP inhibitor cytotoxicity in Ewing’s Sarcoma cells was potentiated 10-1,000 fold by DNA damaging agents (irinotecan and temozolomide). To extend these studies in vivo, we developed an orthotopic Ewing’s Sarcoma mouse model and performed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies with three different PARP inhibitors (BMN-673, olaparib and veliparib) in clinical development for pediatric cancer. Those data were used to design preclinical phase I studies to identify tolerable drug combinations for pilot efficacy testing (preclinical phase II). Based on the results of the preclinical phase I/II data, we performed a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled preclinical phase III trial with 274 mice in 15 treatment groups. Irinotecan administered in a low-dose protracted schedule optimized for pediatric patients was an effective DNA damaging agent to combine with olaparib and BMN-673 and was better tolerated than combinations with temozolomide. Combining olaparib or BMN-673 with irinotecan and temozolomide gave complete and durable responses in over 80% of the mice."

EGAS00001001020,genome wide prediction  human embryos,"BACKGROUND:
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) enables profiling of embryos for genetic disorders prior to implantation. The majority of PGD testing is restricted in the scope of variants assayed or by the availability of extended family members. While recent advances in single cell sequencing show promise, they remain limited by bias in DNA amplification and the rapid turnaround time (&lt;36 h) required for fresh embryo transfer. Here, we describe and validate a method for inferring the inherited whole genome sequence of an embryo for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD).
METHODS:
We combine haplotype-resolved, parental genome sequencing with rapid embryo genotyping to predict the whole genome sequence of a day-5 human embryo in a couple at risk of transmitting alpha-thalassemia.
RESULTS:
Inheritance was predicted at approximately 3 million paternally and/or maternally heterozygous sites with greater than 99% accuracy. Furthermore, we successfully phase and predict the transmission of an HBA1/HBA2 deletion from each parent.
CONCLUSIONS:
Our results suggest that preimplantation whole genome prediction may facilitate the comprehensive diagnosis of diseases with a known genetic basis in embryos."

We hypothesized that differences in fragment lengths of circulating DNA could be exploited to enhance sensitivity for detecting the presence of ctDNA and for non-invasive genomic analysis of cancer. We surveyed ctDNA fragment sizes in 344 plasma samples from 200 cancer patients using low-pass whole-genome sequencing (0.4×). To establish the size distribution of mutant ctDNA, tumor-guided personalized deep sequencing was performed in 19 patients. We detected enrichment of ctDNA in fragment sizes between 90–150 bp, and developed methods for in vitro and in silico size selection of these fragments. Selecting fragments between 90–150 bp improved detection of tumor DNA, with more than 2-fold median enrichment in &amp;gt;95% of cases, and more than 4-fold enrichment in &amp;gt; 10% of cases. Analysis of size-selected cfDNA identified clinically actionable mutations and copy number alterations that were otherwise not detected. Identification of plasma samples from patients with advanced cancer was improved by predictive models integrating fragment length and copy number analysis of cfDNA, with AUC&amp;gt; 0.99 compared to AUC &amp;lt; 0.80 without fragmentation features. Increased identification of cfDNA from patients with glioma, renal, and pancreatic cancer was achieved with AUC &amp;gt; 0.91, compared to AUC &amp;lt; 0.5 without fragmentation features. Fragment size analysis and selective sequencing of specific fragment sizes can boost ctDNA detection.

T-cell-immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3) is a modulator of immune responses expressed on subgroups of T- and innate immune cells. We identify in ~60% of SPTCL cases germline, loss-of-function, missense variants in highly conserved residues of TIM-3, c.245A&gt;G(p.Y82C) and c.291A&gt;G(p.I97M), each with specific geographic distribution. Y82C-TIM-3 occurs on a potential founder chromosome in patients with East Asian and Polynesian ancestry, while I97M-TIM-3 occurs in Caucasians. Both variants induce protein misfolding and abrogate TIM-3’s plasma-membrane expression leading to persistent immune activation, increased production of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-1β, promoting HLH and SPTCL. Our findings highlight HLH/SPTCL as a new genetic entity and showcase TIM-3 mutations as the first causative genetic defect in SPTCL. While TIM-3-mutant HLH/SPTCL benefit from immunomodulation, therapeutic repression of the TIM-3 checkpoint may have adverse consequences."
EGAS00001002211,cancerlocator  invasive cancer diagnosis  tissue  origin prediction  methylation profiles  cell free dna,"Background: The detection and characterization of cell-free DNA in plasma is one of the most promising new areas in cancer diagnosis. Liquid biopsy, unlike traditional tissue biopsy, has the potential to diagnose a variety of different malignancies. Results: Here we propose a probabilistic method, CancerLocator, which exploits the diagnostic potential of cell-free DNA by determining not only the presence but also the location of tumors. CancerLocator simultaneously infers the proportions and the tissue-of-origin of tumor-derived cell-free DNA in a blood sample using genome-wide DNA methylation data. We comprehensively evaluate CancerLocator with simulations and real data, and compare its performance with that of two established multi-class classification methods. We show that the predicted tumor burdens are highly consistent with the true values. In addition, when the proportion of tumor-derived DNAs in the cell-free DNAs is low, the two popular machine learning methods completely fail for cancer diagnosis, while CancerLocator successfully overcomes the challenge. CancerLocator also achieves promising results on patient plasma samples, despite the fact that the DNA methylation data from these samples has very low sequencing coverage. Conclusions: CfDNA methylation may be developed as an important approach for non-invasive early cancer diagnosis."

HCA deep dive human adult Lung: The Human Cell Atlas initiative is an ambitious global research effort which aims to describe every cell in the human body across all developmental stages to generate a reference map to accelerate progress in science and medicine particularly relating to human development and disease. The initiative is led by investigators based at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and funding support from the Wellcome and NIH. This specific project will assess epigenetic and transcriptomic landscape of cells in the adult human lung. We aim to interrogate the cellular composition and molecular regulators underpinning a cells identity through genetic and genomic analysis, expression analysis, non-identifiable video imaging, and cell line and organoid production as well as computational algorithms to predict cellular developmental trajectories and cell-cell interactions.

EGAS00001001014,spatial heterogeneity  medulloblastoma,"Spatial heterogeneity of transcriptional and genetic markers between physically isolated biopsies of a single tumor poses major barriers to the identification of biomarkers and the development of targeted therapies that will be effective against the entire tumor. We analyzed the spatial heterogeneity of multiregional biopsies from 35 patients, using a combination of transcriptomic and genomic profiles. Medulloblastomas (MBs), but not high-grade gliomas (HGGs), demonstrated spatially homogeneous transcriptomes, which allowed for accurate subgrouping of tumors from a single biopsy. Conversely, somatic mutations that affect genes suitable for targeted therapeutics demonstrated high levels of spatial heterogeneity in MB, malignant glioma, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Actionable targets found in a single MB biopsy were seldom clonal across the entire tumor,which brings the efficacy of monotherapies against a single target into question. Clinical trials of targeted therapies for MB should first ensure the spatially ubiquitous nature of the target mutation."

EGAS00001000899,seqcontrol process control  dna sequencing,"As next-generation sequencing (NGS) continues to increase in speed and throughput, routine clinical and industrial application draws steadily closer. These “production” uses of NGS will require enhanced quality-monitoring and quality-control to optimize output and reduce costs. We therefore developed a framework called SeqControl for predicting sequencing quality and coverage using a set of 15 metrics describing overall coverage, coverage distribution, base-wise coverage and base-wise quality. Using whole-genome sequences of 27 prostate cancers and 26 normal references we derive multivariate models that predict sequencing quality and depth. SeqControl robustly predicts how much sequencing is required to reach a given coverage depth (AUC = 0.993), accurately classifies clinically relevant formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples and makes predictions from as little as 1/8 of a lane of sequencing data (AUC = 0.967). These techniques can be immediately incorporated into existing NGS pipelines to monitor data quality in real-time. SeqControl represents a first step towards statistical process-control for NGS."
EGAS00001002226,aging  genome wide patterns  dna methylation   african rainforest hunter gathering population,"Aging is associated with widespread changes in genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation. Thousands of CpG sites whose tissue-specific methylation levels are strongly correlated with chronological age have been previously identified. However, the majority of these studies have focused primarily on cosmopolitan populations living in the developed world; it is not known if age-related patterns of DNA methylation at these loci are similar across a broad range of human genetic and ecological diversity. We investigated genome-wide methylation patterns using saliva derived DNA from a traditionally hunting and gathering African populations: the Baka of the western Central African rainforest, together with the ≠Khomani San of the South African Kalahari Desert. We identify hundreds of CpG sites whose methylation levels are significantly associated with age, thousands that are significant in a meta-analysis, and replicate trends previously reported in populations of non-African descent. We confirm that an age associated site in the gene ELOVL2 shows a remarkably congruent relationship with aging in humans, despite extensive genetic and environmental variation across populations. We also demonstrate that genotype state at methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) can affect methylation trends at some known age-associated CpG sites. Our study explores the relationship between CpG methylation and chronological age in populations of African hunter-gatherers, who rely on different diets across diverse ecologies. While many age-related CpG sites replicate across populations, we show that considering common genetic variation at meQTLs further improves our ability to detect previously identified age associations."
EGAS00001003085,exome sequencing  bipolar disorder families,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a major psychiatric disorder affecting around 1% of the global population. BD is characterized by recurrent manic and depressive episodes, and has an estimated heritability of around 70% Research has identified the first BD susceptibility genes. However, the underlying pathways and regulatory networks remain largely unknown. Since research has shown that the cumulative impact of common alleles with small effect appears to explain only around 25-38% of the phenotypic variance for BD, rare variants of high penetrance may also contribute to BD risk. 
The present study investigated the role of rare, nonsynonymous, and potentially functional variants via whole exome sequencing in 15 BD cases from two large, multiply affected families from Cuba. The high prevalence of BD in these pedigrees renders them promising in terms of the identification of genetic risk variants with large effect sizes. In addition, SNP array data were used to calculate polygenic risk scores for affected and unaffected family members.
After correction for multiple testing, polygenic risk scores for common, BD-associated genetic variants were not significantly higher in BD cases than in healthy relatives. 
Exome sequencing identified a total of 17 rare and potentially damaging variants in 17 genes. The identified variants were shared by all investigated BD cases in the respective pedigree. The most promising variant was located in the gene SERPING1 (p.L349F), which has been reported as a genome-wide significant risk gene for schizophrenia. A further promising variant was located in CAPN2, which has been implicated in synaptic plasticity. 
The present data suggest novel candidate genes for BD susceptibility, and may facilitate the discovery of disease-relevant pathways and regulatory networks."

To identify potential targets for personalized treatment, integrative genome- and epigenome-wide analyses were performed. The results show frequently aberrant DNA methylation, abundant chromosomal amplifications and deletions, and mutational signatures suggesting defective DNA repair. In contrast to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, no recurrent point mutations are known. The tumor suppressors ID3, ARID1A, APC, and CDKN2A are frequently impaired also on the protein level and thus potentially affect ACC tumorigenesis. Consequently, this work identifies potential novel therapeutic targets in ACC for drugs recently approved for precision cancer therapy."

EGAS00001000936,ischemic stroke   swedish case control study,"Background. Genetic risk scores (GRS), summing up the total effect of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes associated with either coronary risk or cardiovascular risk factors, have been tested for association with ischemic stroke with conflicting results. Recently an association was found between a GRS, based on 29 SNPs discovered by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and hypertension. The aim of our study was to investigate the possible association of the same GRS with ischemic stroke on top of other “traditional risk factors”, also testing its potential improvement in indices of discrimination and reclassification, in a Swedish case-control study. Methods and  results. Twenty-nine SNPs were genotyped in 3,677 stroke cases and 2,415 controls included in the Lund Stroke Register (LSR), the Malmö Diet and Cancer (MDC) study and the Sahlgrenska Academy Study on Ischemic Stroke (SAHLSIS). The analysis was conducted in the entire material, and separately for the three samples.   After adjustment for hypertension, diabetes mellitus and smoking habits, the GRS was associated with ischemic stroke in the entire material [OR (95% CI) 1.086 (1.029-1.147) per SD increase in the GRS p=0.003] with similar trends in all three samples; LSR [1.050 (0.967-1.140)]; p=0.25], MDC [1.168 (1.060-1.288); p=0.002] and SAHLSIS [1.124 (0.997-1.267); P=0.055]. Measures of discrimination and reclassification improved marginally using the GRS. Conclusions. A blood pressure GRS is independently associated with ischemic stroke risk in three Swedish case-control studies, however, the effect size is low and adds marginally to prediction of stroke on top of traditional risk factors including hypertension."

EGAS00001002275, genome sequencing suggests mechanisms  22q11 2 deletion associated parkinson  disease,"Objectives: To investigate disease risk mechanisms of early-onset Parkinson’s disease (PD) associated with the recurrent 22q11.2 deletion, a genetic risk factor for early-onset PD.
Methods: In a proof-of-principle study, we used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to investigate sequence variants in nine adults with 22q11.2DS, three with neuropathologically confirmed early-onset PD and six without PD. Adopting an approach used recently to study schizophrenia in 22q11.2DS, here we tested candidate gene-sets relevant to PD.
Results: No mutations common to the cases with PD were found in the intact 22q11.2 region. While all were negative for rare mutations in a gene-set comprising PD disease-causing and risk genes, another candidate gene-set of 1000 genes functionally relevant to PD presented a nominally significant (P=0.03) enrichment of rare putatively damaging missense variants in the PD cases. Polygenic score results, based on common variants associated with PD risk, were non-significantly greater in those with PD.
Conclusions: The results of this first-ever pilot study of WGS in PD suggest that the cumulative burden of genome-wide sequence variants may contribute to expression of early-onset PD in the presence of threshold-lowering dosage effects of a 22q11.2 deletion. We found no evidence that expression of PD in 22q11.2DS is mediated by a recessive locus on the intact 22q11.2 chromosome or mutations in known PD genes. These findings offer initial evidence of the potential effects of multiple within-individual rare variants on the expression of PD and the utility of next generation sequencing for studying the etiology of PD."
EGAS00001003190,clonal decomposition  dna replication states defined  scaled single cell genome sequencing,"Accurate measurement of clonal genotypes, mutational processes, and replication states from individual tumor-cell genomes will facilitate improved understanding of tumor evolution. We have developed DLP+, a scalable single-cell whole-genome sequencing platform implemented using commodity instruments, image-based object recognition, and open source computational methods. Using DLP+, we have generated a resource of 51,926 single-cell genomes and matched cell images from diverse cell types including cell lines, xenografts, and diagnostic samples with limited material. From this resource we have defined variation in mitotic mis-segregation rates across tissue types and genotypes. Analysis of matched genomic and image measurements revealed correlations between cellular morphology and genome ploidy states. Aggregation of cells sharing copy number profiles allowed for calculation of single-nucleotide resolution clonal genotypes and inference of clonal phylogenies and avoided the limitations of bulk deconvolution. Finally, joint analysis over the above features defined clone-specific chromosomal aneuploidy in polyclonal populations."
EGAS00001000962,plasma dna aberrations  systemic lupus erythematosus revealed  genomic  methylomic sequencing,"We performed a high-resolution analysis of the biological characteristics of plasma DNA in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients using massively parallel genomic and methylomic sequencing. A number of plasma DNA abnormalities were found. First, aberrations in measured genomic representations (MGRs) were identified in the plasma DNA of SLE patients. The extent of the aberrations in MGRs correlated with anti-double–stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody level. Second, the plasma DNA of active SLE patients exhibited skewed molecular size-distribution profiles with a significantly increased proportion of short DNA fragments. The extent of plasma DNA shortening in SLE patients correlated with the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) and anti-dsDNA antibody level. Third, the plasma DNA of active SLE patients showed decreased methylation densities. The extent of hypomethylation correlated with SLEDAI and anti-dsDNA antibody level. To explore the impact of anti-dsDNA antibody on plasma DNA in SLE, a column-based protein G capture approach was used to fractionate the IgG-bound and non–IgG-bound DNA in plasma. Compared with healthy individuals, SLE patients had higher concentrations of IgG-bound DNA in plasma. More IgG binding occurs at genomic locations showing increased MGRs. Furthermore, the IgG-bound plasma DNA was shorter in size and more hypomethylated than the non–IgG-bound plasma DNA. These observations have enhanced our understanding of the spectrum of plasma DNA aberrations in SLE and may provide new molecular markers for SLE. Our results also suggest that caution should be exercised when interpreting plasma DNA-based noninvasive prenatal testing and cancer testing conducted for SLE patients."

Exome sequencing analysis of 243 liver tumors revealed mutational signatures associated with specific risk factors, mainly combined alcohol/tobacco consumption, aflatoxin B1 and HBV infection. We identified 161 putative driver genes associated with 11 recurrent pathways. Associations of mutations defined 3 groups of genes related to risk factors and centered on CTNNB1 (alcohol), TP53 (HBV) and AXIN1. Analyses according to tumor stage progression revealed TERT promoter mutation as an early event whereas FGF/CCND1 amplification, TP53 and CDKN2A alterations appeared at more advanced stages in aggressive tumors. In 24% of the tumors, we identified genetic alterations potentially targetable by FDA-approved drugs. In conclusion, we identified risk factor–specific mutational signatures and defined the extensive landscape of altered genes and pathways in HCC, which will be useful to design clinical trials for targeted therapy."

Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the epigenetic landscape of GC-B-cell lymphomas using whole genome bisulfite sequencing paired with genome and transcriptome sequencing from 29 primary tumor samples and four normal GC-B-cell samples. All lymphomas studied showed extensive genome-wide methylation losses as well as intragenic regions where DNA methylation levels were strongly correlated with expression of associated genes. Pathway analysis revealed that these intragenic regions were enriched in signaling networks differentially activated in Burkitt and follicular lymphomas and affected regulatory mechanisms deregulated by recurrent mutations in a large fraction of Burkitt lymphomas (including the ID3/TCF3 complex, the SWI/SNF remodeling complex and the inhibitory GI signaling pathway). Taken together, these results provide a global picture of Burkitt lymphoma pathomechanism and demonstrate a tight connection between epigenetic regulation and other levels of regulatory control in these tumors."

HSTLs manifest frequent mutations in STAT5B (31%), STAT3 (9%), and PIK3CD (9%) for which there currently exist potential targeted therapies. In addition, we noted less frequent events in EZH2, KRAS and TP53. SETD2 was the most frequently silenced gene in HSTL. We experimentally demonstrated that SETD2 acts as a tumor suppressor gene. In addition, we found that mutations in STAT5B and PIK3CD activate critical signaling pathways important to cell survival in HSTL. Our work thus defines the genetic landscape of HSTL and implicates novel gene mutations linked to HSTL pathogenesis and potential treatment targets."

The mutational consequences of disruption to both repair components in humans are not well studied. We sequenced cancer genomes from children with inherited biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD). High-grade bMMRD brain tumors exhibited massive numbers of substitution mutations (&gt;250/Mb) – higher than all childhood and most cancers (&gt;7000 analyzed). All ultra-hypermutated bMMRD cancers acquired early somatic driver mutations in DNA polymerases epsilon or delta. The ensuing mutation signatures and numbers are unique and diagnostic of childhood germline bMMRD (p&lt;10e-13). Sequential tumor biopsy analysis revealed that bMMRD/polymerase mutant cancers rapidly amass an excess of simultaneous mutations (~600 mutations/cell division), reaching but not exceeding ~20,000 exonic mutations in &lt;6 months. Thus implying a threshold compatible with cancer cell survival. We suggest a new mechanism of cancer progression in which mutations develop in a rapid burst after ablation of replication repair."

EGAS00001001170,recursive splicing  long vertebrate genes,"Recent studies have shown that expression of many genes with exceptionally long introns in the mammalian brain can be perturbed by regulatory factors linked to neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders1-3, suggesting unique regulatory mechanisms. Here we identify functional recursive splice sites (RSS) in long introns of genes expressed in the brain. These RSS are highly conserved in genes with extreme length across diverse vertebrate species and permit step-wise removal of long introns via recursive splicing. Recursive splicing requires initial definition of a “recursive exon” that is located downstream of RSS, and most often contains premature stop codons. Moreover, we show that RSS create a splicing switch driven by splice site competition in order to distinguish primary mRNA isoforms from alternative isoforms that are prevalent in long genes. The recursive exon is not detectable in the dominant mRNA isoform due to recursive splicing, but is completely included when cryptic promoters or other cryptic exons are used. Thus, by coupling inclusion of recursive exons with the use of cryptic elements, RSS act to distinguish new mRNA isoforms emerging from long genes."

DNA hypermethylation of the O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter is associated with an improved response to TMZ treatment, while inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway is associated with therapeutic resistance and TMZ-induced mutagenesis. We previously demonstrated that TMZ treatment of LGG induces driver mutations in the RB and AKT-mTOR pathways, which may drive malignant progression to secondary GBM. To better understand the mechanisms underlying TMZ-induced mutagenesis and malignant progression, we explored the evolution of MGMT methylation and genetic alterations affecting MMR genes in a cohort of 34 treatment-naïve LGGs and their recurrences. Recurrences with TMZ-associated hypermutation had increased MGMT methylation compared to their untreated initial tumors and higher overall MGMT methylation compared to TMZ-treated non-hypermutated recurrences. A TMZ-associated mutation in one or more MMR genes was observed in five out of six TMZ-treated hypermutated recurrences. In two cases, pre-existing heterozygous deletions encompassing MGMT, or an MMR gene, were followed by TMZ-associated mutations in one of the genes of interest. These results suggest that tumor cells with methylated MGMT may undergo positive selection during TMZ treatment in the context of MMR deficiency."

EGAS00001001191,genome wide dna methylation assessment  methylcap seq  infinium humanmethylation450 beadchips  independent large scale comparison,"DNA-methylation is an important epigenetic feature in health and disease. Two cost-efficient genome-scale methodologies to assess DNA-methylation are MethylCap-seq and Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips (HM450). However, objective information regarding the best-suited methodology for a specific research question is scant. Therefore, we performed a large-scale evaluation on a set of 70 brain tissue samples obtained from 65 glioblastoma and 5 non-tumoral brain tissues, using a gold standard free Bayesian modeling procedure. While conditional specificity was adequate for both approaches, conditional sensitivity was systematically higher for HM450. Also the genome-wide characteristics were compared, revealing that the HM450 probes assess less than 10% of the regions identified as methylated by MethylCap-seq. Hence the latter method may detect more potentially relevant DNA-methylation, defined by either functional location or previously reported differentially methylated candidate regions. Our results therefore indicate that – at least for the tissue under study - both methodologies are complementary, with a higher sensitivity for HM450, but a far larger genome-wide coverage for MethylCap-seq. Note that here only the relevant MethylCap-seq data is deposited, for the HM450 data we refer to GEO (GSE60274)."
EGAS00001003140,automated image based profiling  complex drug induced phenotypes  patient derived organoids,"We established a platform for high-throughput confocal fluorescence microscopy and automated image analysis to perform large-scale drug response profiling with patient derived organoids (PDOs). Using PDO lines newly established from colorectal cancer patients with a standardized workflow, we performed chemical perturbations with more than 500 experimental and clinically used compounds. Subsequently, we captured approx. six million images by confocal microscopy. To analyze drug-induced PDO re-organization on a single organoid level we developed SCOPE, a software framework for automated PDO high-throughput image analysis. We observed a rich variety of divergent and reoccurring compound induced phenotypes in organoids. Perturbation of cellular processes, including signaling by MEK, GSK3β, cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and others, led to recurring and distinct architectural changes. Highlighting the clinical relevance, PDO viability was heterogeneous after perturbation with anticancer drugs and matched clinical response of corresponding colorectal cancer patients. Our work opens new avenues for image-based profiling for accelerated drug discovery and clinical decision-making."

It is a fibroproliferative disorder of the palmer fascia, causing flexion contractures of affected digits. DD affects men more commonly than women. DD is an archetypal complex disease, with multiple genetic and environmental factors affecting the final expression of the disease phenotype. The incidence increases with age, and the prevalence of DD is therefore increasing as the UK population ages. Half of all patients present before age 60. DD causes significant functional impairment, and severe contractures can lead to permanent disability. The mainstay of current treatment is surgery, but recurrence and complications are both high. For severe contractures, the only suitable treatment option is amputation. The direct costs to the NHS are high, and underestimate the true economic costs to society. We collected salivary samples from adults in the UK who have had surgery for DD. We have genotyped these samples using the Illumina HumanCoreExome Beadchips.  https://research.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/public/dupuytrens/what-is-dupuytrens-disease/"

We used massively-parallel-sequencing–based assays to evaluate the ability of ctDNA to detect minimal residual disease in 1046 plasma samples from a prospective cohort of 230 patients with resected stage II colon cancer. In patients not treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, ctDNA was detected post-operatively in 14 of 178 (7.9%) patients, 11 (79%) of whom had recurred at a median follow-up of 27 months; recurrence occurred in only 16 (9.8 %) of the 164 patients with negative ctDNA (HR, 18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.9 to 36; P&lt;0.001). In patients treated with chemotherapy, the presence of ctDNA following completion of chemotherapy was also associated with an inferior recurrence-free survival (HR, 11; 95% CI, 1.8  to 68; P=0.001). ctDNA detection after stage II colon cancer resection provides direct evidence of residual disease and identifies patients at very high risk of recurrence."

Whole transcriptome profiles were generated for 368 patients using TruSeq RNA Access technology (Illumina). Somatic mutations were determined via whole exome sequencing for a subset of these patients.  - Response was associated with CD8+ T effector cell phenotype and, to an even greater extent, high neoantigen or tumour mutation burden (TMB). On the other hand, lack of response was associated with a transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signature, particularly in patients with CD8+ T cells preferentially residing in collagen-rich matrix surrounding tumours. Integration of these three independent biological features provided the best basis for understanding outcome in this setting. -"
EGAS00001002490,mutational signatures  aflatoxin,"Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a mutagen and IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer) Group 1 carcinogen that causes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we present the first whole genome data on the mutational signatures of AFB1 exposure from a total of &gt; 40,000 mutations in four experimental systems: two different human cell lines, and in liver tumors in wild-type mice and in mice that carried a hepatitis B surface antigen transgene – this to model the multiplicative effects of aflatoxin exposure and hepatitis B in causing HCC. AFB1 mutational signatures from all four experimental systems were remarkably similar. We integrated the experimental mutational signatures with data from newly-sequenced HCCs from Qidong County, China, a region of well-studied aflatoxin exposure. This indicated that COSMIC mutational signature 24, previously hypothesized to stem from aflatoxin exposure, indeed likely represents AFB1 exposure, possibly combined with other exposures. Among published somatic mutation data, we found evidence of AFB1 exposure in 0.7% of HCCs treated in North America, 1% of HCCs from Japan, but 16% of HCCs from Hong Kong. Thus, aflatoxin exposure apparently remains a substantial public health issue in some areas. This aspect of our study exemplifies the promise of future widespread resequencing of tumor genomes in providing new insights into the contribution of mutagenic exposures to cancer incidence."

To unravel the regulatory programsbehind these changes, we applied systems immunology approaches and profiled chromatin accessibility and the transcriptomein PBMCs, purified monocytes, and B and T cells. Analysis of samples from 77 young and elderly donors revealed a novel androbust aging signature in PBMCs, with simultaneous systematic chromatin closing at promoters and enhancers associated withT cell signaling and a potentially stochastic chromatin opening mostly found at quiescent and repressed sites. Combined analysesof chromatin accessibility and the transcriptome uncovered immune molecules activated/inactivated with aging andidentified the silencing of the IL7R gene and the IL-7 signaling pathway genes as potential biomarkers. This signature is borneby memory CD8+ T cells, which exhibited an aging-related loss in binding of NF-κB and STAT factors. Thus, our study providesa unique and comprehensive approach to identifying candidate biomarkers and provides mechanistic insights into aging-associatedimmunodeficiency."

Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a prevalent immune-mediated complication following HSCT. Current diagnostic biomarkers that correlate with aGVHD severity, progression, and therapy response in graft recipients are insufficient. We investigated whether epigenetic marks measured in peripheral blood of healthy graft donors stratify aGVHD severity in HLA-matched sibling recipients prior to HSCT. We measured genome-wide DNA methylation levels in peripheral blood of 91 HSCT donors using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. We showed that epigenetic signatures underlying aGVHD severity in recipients correspond to immune pathways relevant to aGVHD etiology. We identified distinct DNA methylation marks in graft donors that are associated with aGVHD severity status in recipients. Together, our findings suggest that ‘epigenetic matching’ of HSCT donor-recipient pairs in a clinical setting may be used in conjunction with genetic matching to inform both donor selection and transplantation strategy, with the ultimate aim of improving patient outcome."

In addition to single variant tests we incorporated information on the predicted functional consequences of PAVs and analysed sets of genes with a higher likelihood of having a role in glioma on the basis of the profile of somatic mutations documented by large-scale sequencing initiatives. Globally tThere was a strong relationship between effect size and SNPs predicted to be damaging (P=2.29x10-49); however, these variants which are most likely to impact on risk, are rare (MAF&lt;5%). While no single variant showed an association which was statistically significant at the genomewide threshold a number of represented promising Notable associations - were seen with the BRCA2:c.9976A&gt;T, p.(Lys3326Ter)BRCA2 p.Lys332X variant,  which has been shown documented to influence breast and lung cancer risks (OR=2.3, P=4.00x10-4 for glioblastoma [GBM]) and IDH2:c.782G&gt;A, p.(Arg261His)IDH2 p.Arg261His (OR=3.21, P=7.67x10-3, for non-GBM). Additionally, gene burden tests revealed a statistically significant association for HARS2 and risk of GBM (P=2.20x10-6). Genome scans of low frequency PAVs represent a complementary strategy to identify disease-causing variants compared with scans based on tagSNPs. Strategies to lessen the multiple testing burden by restricting analysis to PAVs with higher priors affords an opportunity to maximise study power."
EGAS00001002798,hominin specific notch2 paralogs expand human cortical neurogenesis  regulation  delta notch interactions,"The human cerebral cortex has undergone rapid expansion and increased complexity during recent evolution. Hominid-specific gene duplications represent a major driving force of evolution, but their impact on human brain evolution remains unclear. Using tailored RNA sequencing (RNAseq), we profiled the spatial and temporal expression of Hominid-specific duplicated (HS) genes in the human fetal cortex, leading to the identification of a repertoire of 36 HS genes displaying robust and dynamic patterns during cortical neurogenesis. Among these we focused on NOTCH2NL, previously uncharacterized HS paralogs of NOTCH2. NOTCH2NL promote the clonal expansion of human cortical progenitors by increasing self-renewal, ultimately leading to higher neuronal output. NOTCH2NL function by activating the Notch pathway, through inhibition of Delta/Notch interactions. Our study uncovers a large repertoire of recently evolved genes linking genomic evolution to human brain development, and reveals how hominin-specific NOTCH paralogs may have contributed to the expansion of the human cortex.

The dataset contains raw sequences (FASTQ files) from the Illumina 2x150bp paired-end RNA sequencing profiles of 11 fetal human brain samples at 7, 9, 12, 15 and 21 gestational weeks."

Here we show these opposing effects are a result of the synergy between SMAD3, a downstream effector of TGFβ signalling, and the distinct epigenomes of breast tumor initiating cells (BTICs). These effects of TGFβ are associated with distinct gene expression programs, but genomic SMAD3 binding patterns are highly similar in the BTIC-promoting and BTIC- suppressing contexts. Our data show cell type-specific epigenetic configurations provide a modulatory layer by determining accessibility of genes to regulation by TGFβ/SMAD3. LBH, one such context-specific target gene, is regulated according to its DNA methylation status, and is crucial for TGFβ-dependent promotion of BTICs. Overall, these results reveal that the epigenome plays a central and previously overlooked role in shaping the context-specific effects of TGFβ in cancer."

EGAS00001001575,prenatal lead exposure  associated  decreased cord blood dna methylation   glycoprotein vi gene involved  platelet activation  thrombus formation,"Early-life lead exposure impairs neurodevelopment and later exposure affects the cardiovascular system. Lead has been associated with reduced global 5-methylcytosine DNA methylation, suggesting that lead toxicity acts through epigenetic mechanisms. The objective of this study is to clarify how early life lead exposure alters DNA methylation of specific genes, using an epigenomic approach. We measured lead concentrations in urine (gestational week, GW, 8) and erythrocytes (GW 14), using ICP-MS, for 127 pregnant mothers recruited in the MINIMat food and supplementation cohort in rural Bangladesh. Cord blood DNA methylation was analyzed with the Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip and top sites were validated by methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt curve analysis. Maternal urinary lead concentrations (divided into quartiles) showed significant (after adjustment for FDR) inverse associations with methylation at nine CpGs. Three of these sites were in the 5’ end, including the promoter, of glycoprotein IV (GP6); cg18355337 (q=0.029, β=-0.30), cg25818583 (q=0.041, β=-0.18) and cg23796967 (q=0.047, β=-0.17). The methylation in another CpG site in GP6 was close to significant (cg05374025, q=0.057, β=-0.23). The erythrocyte lead concentrations (divided into quartiles) were also inversely associated with CpG methylation in GP6, although this was not statistically significant after FDR-adjustments. Eight CpG sites in GP6 constituted a differentially methylated region in relation to urinary lead (p=0.005, q=0.48) and erythrocyte lead (p=0.007, q=0.46). In conclusion, we found that moderate prenatal lead exposure appear to epigenetically affect GP6, a key component of platelet aggregation and thrombus formation, suggesting a novel link between early lead exposure and cardiovascular disease later in life."

Herein we demonstrate that a significant proportion of institutionally diagnosed CNS-PNETs display molecular profiles indistinguishable from those of various other well defined CNS tumor entities, facilitating diagnosis and appropriate therapy for patients with these tumors. From the remaining fraction of CNS-PNETs we identify four new CNS tumor entities, each associated with a recurrent genetic alteration and distinct histopathological and clinical features. These new molecular entities, designated “CNS neuroblastoma with FOXR2 activation (CNS NB-FOXR2)”, “CNS Ewing sarcoma family tumor with CIC alteration (CNS EFT-CIC)”, “CNS high grade neuroepithelial tumor with MN1 alteration (CNS HGNET-MN1)”, and “CNS high grade neuroepithelial tumor with BCOR alteration (CNS HGNET-BCOR)”, will enable meaningful clinical trials and the development of therapeutic strategies for patients affected by poorly differentiated CNS tumors."
EGAS00001002678,genome wide analysis  genetic risk factors  rheumatic heart disease  aboriginal australians  support  pathogenic molecular mimicry,"Background. Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) following Group A Streptococcus (GAS) infections is heritable and prevalent in Indigenous populations. Molecular mimicry between human and GAS proteins triggers pro-inflammatory cardiac valve-reactive T-cells. Methods. Genome-wide genetic analysis was undertaken in 1263 Aboriginal Australians (398 RHD cases; 865 controls). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped using Illumina HumanCoreExome BeadChips.  Direct typing and imputation was used to fine-map the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. Epitope binding affinities were mapped for human cross-reactive GAS proteins, including M5 and M6.   Results. The strongest genetic association was intronic to HLA-DQA1 (rs9272622; P=1.86x10-7). Conditional analyses showed rs9272622 and/or DQA1*AA16 account for the HLA signal. HLA-DQA1*0101_DQB1*0503 (OR 1.44, 95%CI 1.09-1.90, P=9.56x10-3) and HLA-DQA1*0103_DQB1*0601 (OR 1.27, 95%CI 1.07-1.52, P=7.15x10-3) were risk haplotypes; HLA_DQA1*0301-DQB1*0402 (OR 0.30, 95%CI 0.14-0.65, P=2.36x10-3) was protective.  Human myosin cross-reactive N-terminal and B repeat epitopes of GAS M5/M6 bind with higher affinity to DQA1/DQB1 alpha/beta dimers for the two risk haplotypes than the protective haplotype.  Conclusions. Variation at HLA_DQA1-DQB1 is the major genetic risk factor for RHD in Aboriginal Australians studied here. Cross-reactive epitopes bind with higher affinity to alpha/beta dimers formed by risk haplotypes, supporting molecular mimicry as the key mechanism of RHD pathogenesis."

EGAS00001000854,systems biology  colorectal cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers in both males and females, and it is perhaps the best understood of all epithelial tumors in terms of its molecular origin. Yet, despite large amount of work that has concentrated on understanding of colon tumorigenesis, we still do not know the full complement of molecular lesions that are individually necessary – and together sufficient – to cause colorectal cancer. Neither do we understand why some specific mutations that are relatively rare in other tumors (e.g. loss of the APC tumor suppressor) are extremely common in colorectal cancer. We propose here to use the tools of systems biology to develop a quantitative and comprehensive model of colorectal tumorigenesis. The model will include identification of cell-type specific and oncogenic pathways that contribute to colon tumorigenesis, and explain in molecular detail how a genotype of an individual CRC leads to activation of downstream genes that drive uncontrolled cell growth. This model will subsequently be used to find novel therapeutic targets, to guide genetic screening to identify individuals with elevated risk for developing CRC, and to classify patients into molecular subgroups to select the treatment combination that is optimal for each patient (personalized medicine).    The specific objectives of the SYSCOL project are: 1. Identify genetic markers for individual risk using genotyping and sequencing of constitutional DNA from sporadic and familial CRC cases and controls 2. Identify genes and regulatory elements that contribute to colorectal cancer cell growth 3. Use data from Aims 1-2 to develop a quantitative model for colorectal tumorigenesis 4.

EGAS00001002863,small molecule inhibitors  melanoma kenski kong wes,"Small-molecule inhibitors targeting the most commonly activated pathway in melanoma, MAPK pathway (either alone or in combination) are already given to melanoma patients for few years, and initially reduce tumour burden dramatically, eventually melanomas become resistant and tumours progress while on treatment. Resistance to this treatment occurs by acquisition of additional mutations or other alterations that affect the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway by either direct or indirect signalling. Many resistance mechanisms somehow lead to reactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), thereby restoring signalling of the oncogenic BRAF/MEK/ERK pathway. In addition, PI3K pathway activation contributes to resistance to BRAF inhibition. Less frequent but equally important to the phenomenon of targeted drug resistance is the observation that B15–20% of BRAF mutant melanoma patients fail to respond to BRAF inhibition already early on treatment, owing to intrinsic resistance. These patients have little therapeutic options, unless immunotherapy can be given. To better understand the resistance mechanisms in MAPK inhibitor-treated melanoma patients and melanoma biology, our lab generated a big panel of MAPK inhibitor resistant melanoma cell lines by continuous drug exposure. The understanding of the genetic landscape and gene expression as well as cross resistance to other treatment regimens, and other aspects of melanoma biology such as phenotype switch, will allow us to better exploit new therapeutic strategies for melanoma patients."
EGAS00001003592,5 fu treated organoids,"5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a chemotherapeutic drug component that is commonly used for the treatment of solid cancers. ﻿The anticancer properties of 5-FU have been attributed to interference with nucleotide synthesis and through direct incorporation into the DNA as being a pyrimidine analog. As both mechanisms of action may have a mutational impact on surviving tumor cells, we performed three independent analyses to characterize the genomic consequences of 5-FU treatment: i) in vitro treatment of intestinal organoids with 5-FU followed by whole genome sequencing, ii) genome-wide mutation analyses in tumor samples from 5-FU treated patients with breast or colorectal cancer, and iii) analysis of paired biopsies from patients treated with 5-FU between biopsies. Our results demonstrate that both in vitro and in vivo 5-FU causes a mutational pattern that is dominated by T&gt;G substitutions in a CTT context and with strong resemblance to COSMIC signature 17. Interestingly, this signature is also found in non 5-FU treated patients, most prominently in esophageal tumors, indicating that distinct endogenous and exogenous triggers can converge into highly similar mutational signatures. Furthermore, our results suggest that 5-FU may have adverse mutagenic effects on healthy cells and contributes to genetic variability in surviving cancer cells thereby contributing to tumor evolution."

Recent sequencing efforts have confirmed that USARCs exhibit one of the highest burdens of structural aberrations across human cancer. Here, we sought to unravel the molecular basis of the structural complexity in USARCs by integrating DNA sequencing, ploidy analysis, gene expression, and methylation profiling. We identified whole genome duplication as a prevalent and pernicious force in USARC tumorigenesis. Using mathematical deconvolution strategies to unravel the complex copy-number profiles and mutational timing models we infer distinct evolutionary pathways of these rare cancers. In addition, 15% of tumors exhibited raised mutational burdens that correlated with gene expression signatures of immune infiltration, and good prognosis."
EGAS00001003564,probabilistic modeling  personalized drug combinations  integrated chemical screen  molecular data  sarcoma,"Background: Cancer patients with advanced disease exhaust available clinical regimens and lack actionable genomic medicine results, leaving a large patient population without effective treatments options when their disease inevitably progresses. To address the unmet clinical need for evidence-based therapy assignment when standard clinical approaches have failed, we have developed a probabilistic computational modeling approach which integrates sequencing data with functional assay data to develop patient-specific combination cancer treatments. Methods: Tissue taken from a murine model of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma was used to perform single agent drug screening and DNA/RNA sequencing experiments; results integrated via our computational modeling approach identified a synergistic personalized two-drug combination. Cells derived from the tumor were allografted into mouse models and used to validate the personalized two-drug combination. Computational modeling of single agent drug screening and RNA sequencing of multiple heterogenous sites from a single patient’s epithelioid sarcoma identified a personalized two-drug combination effective across all tumor regions. The heterogeneity-consensus combination was validated in a xenograft model derived from the patient’s primary tumor. Cell cultures derived from human and canine undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma were assayed by drug screen; computational modeling identified a resistance-abrogating two-drug combination common to both cell cultures. This combination was validated in vitro via a cell regrowth assay.
Results
Our computational modeling approach addresses three major challenges in personalized cancer therapy: synergistic drug combination predictions (validated in vitro and in vivo in a genetically engineered murine cancer model), identification of unifying therapeutic targets to overcome intra-tumor heterogeneity (validated in vivo in a human cancer xenograft), and mitigation of cancer cell resistance and rewiring mechanisms (validated in vitro in a human and canine cancer model). 
Conclusions
These proof-of-concept studies support the use of an integrative functional approach to personalized combination therapy prediction for the population of high-risk cancer patients lacking viable clinical options and without actionable DNA sequencing-based therapy."

Carcinomas are distinguished from adenomas not by nucleotide-level mutations (drivers or burden), but by widespread aneusomies that are usually clonal and often accrue in a “punctuated” fashion. Adenomas evolve across an undulating fitness landscape, whereas carcinomas occupy a sharper fitness peak, probably owing to stabilising selection."

Here, we quantify the impact of translation on gene expression and annotate novel translational events in 80 human hearts. These include 65 tissues from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) - the most common cause of heart transplantation – and 15 unaffected controls. We show that translational regulation modulates disease-associated molecular processes. Further, we evaluate ribosome dynamics at protein truncating variants revealing incomplete termination of translation at titin-truncating variants (TTNtv) that commonly cause DCM. Finally, we identify dozens of unknown microproteins translated from lncRNAs and circRNAs and link these to mitochondrial processes. Several microproteins are expressed from lncRNAs with previously demonstrated function, suggesting a dual coding and noncoding role. This resource will stimulate novel functional investigations into cardiac biology in health and disease and may serve as a blueprint for characterizing the translational landscape of other human tissues."

Both alleles have relatively low frequencies in the general population, hence meta-analyses have been based on many small, heterogeneous studies. Here we report the APOE-cognition associations in the largest single analysis to date. APOE status and cognitive ability were measured in 18,337 participants from the Generation Scotland study between 2006 and 2011. The age range was 18-94 years with a mean of 47 (SD 15). Four cognitive domains were assessed: verbal declarative memory (paragraph recall), processing speed (digit symbol substitution), verbal fluency (phonemic verbal fluency), and vocabulary (Mill Hill synonyms). Linear regression was used to assess the associations between APOE genetic status and cognition. Possession of the e4 allele was associated with lower scores on the measures of memory and processing speed in subjects aged &gt;60. Across all age ranges, the e4 allele was linked to better verbal fluency scores. In younger subjects (≤60 years) the e4 allele was linked to higher vocabulary scores. There were no associations between the e2 allele and cognitive ability. As seen in previous meta-analyses, the APOE e4 allele is linked to poorer cognitive performance in the domains of memory and processing speed. By contrast, positive associations were seen between the e4 allele and measures of verbal fluency and vocabulary. All associations were relatively small and, in many cases, nominally significant despite the very large sample size."

The MEK/ERK pathway is activated in a large subset of HGSOC, thus making it an attractive therapeutic target. Here, we systematically evaluated the extent of MEK/ERK pathway activation and efficacy of pathway inhibition in a large panel of well-annotated HGSOC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. The vast majority of models were nonresponsive to the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib (GDC-0973) despite effective pathway inhibition.  Proteomic analyses of adaptive responses to GDC-0973 revealed that GDC-0973 upregulated the pro-apoptotic protein BIM, thus priming the cells for apoptosis regulated by BCL2-family proteins. Indeed, combination of both MEK inhibitor and dual BCL-2/XL inhibitor (ABT-263) significantly reduced cell number, increased cell death and displayed synergy in vitro in most models. In vivo, the GDC-0973 and ABT-263 combination was well tolerated and resulted in greater tumor growth inhibition than single agents. Detailed proteomic and correlation analyses identified two subsets of responsive models – those with high BIM at baseline that was increased with MEK inhibition and those with low basal Bim and high pERK levels.  Models with low BIM and low pERK were non-responsive. Our findings demonstrate that combined MEK and BCL-2/XL inhibition has therapeutic activity in HGSOC models and provide a mechanistic rationale for clinical evaluation  of this drug combination as well as the assessment of the extent to which BIM and/or pERK levels predict drug combination effectiveness in chemoresistant HGSOC."

Here we studied differentially expressed coding and non-coding genes in relation to SSc pathogenesis with a specific focus on antisense non-coding RNAs. Skin biopsy-derived RNAs from fourteen early SSc patients and six healthy individuals were sequenced with ion-torrent and analysed using DEseq2. Overall, 4901 genes with a fold change &gt;1.5 and a false discovery rate &lt; 5% were detected in patients versus controls. Upregulated genes clustered in immunological, cell adhesion and keratin-related processes. Interestingly, 676 deregulated non-coding genes were detected, 257 of which were classified as antisense genes. Sense genes expressed opposite of these antisense genes were also deregulated in 42% of the observed sense-antisense gene pairs. The majority of the antisense genes had a similar effect sizes in an independent North American dataset with three genes (CTBP1-AS2, OTUD6B-AS1 and AGAP2-AS1) exceeding the study-wide Bonferroni-corrected ρ-value (PBonf&lt;0.0023, Pcombined = 1.1x10-9, 1.4x10-8, 1.7x10-6, respectively).

To determine the factors that promote the development and evolution of these tumors, we analyzed the genomes of 274 high-grade meningiomas and compared this information with data from 456 low-grade meningiomas. High-grade meningiomas had a higher mutation burden than low-grade meningiomas but did not harbor any statistically significant mutated genes aside from NF2. High-grade meningiomas also possessed significantly elevated rates of chromosomal gains and losses, especially among tumors with monosomy 22. Meningiomas previously treated with adjuvant radiation had significantly more copy number alterations than radiation-induced or radiation-naïve meningiomas. Across serial recurrences, genomic disruption preceded the emergence of nearly all mutations, remained largely uniform across time, and when present in low-grade meningiomas, correlated with subsequent progression to a higher grade. In contrast to the largely stable copy number alterations, mutations were strikingly heterogeneous across tumor recurrences, likely due to extensive geographic heterogeneity in the primary tumor. While high-grade meningiomas harbored significantly fewer overtly targetable alterations than low-grade meningiomas, they contained numerous mutations that are predicted to be neoantigens, suggesting that immunologic targeting may be of therapeutic value."

Yet, a comprehensive characterization of this process is still lacking. Here, we apply 16S rDNA microbiota profiling and matching (GC-MS) metabolomics to assess the consequences of inulin fermentation both on the composition of the colon bacterial ecosystem and fecal metabolites profiles.DesignFecal samples collected during a double blind, randomized, cross-over intervention study (NCT02548247) set up to assess the effect of inulin consumption on stool frequency in healthy adults with mild constipation were analyzed. Fecal microbiota composition and metabolite profiles were linked to the study’s clinical outcome as well as to quality-of-life measurements recorded.ResultsWhile fecal metabolite profiles were not significantly altered by inulin consumption, our analyses did detect a modest effect on global microbiota composition. At the same time, specific inulin-induced changes in relative abundances of Anaerostipes, Bilophila, and Bifidobacterium were identified. The observed decrease in Bilophila abundances following inulin consumption was associated with both softer stools and a favorable change in constipation-specific quality of life measures.ConclusionsEcosystem-wide analysis of the effect of a dietary intervention with prebiotic inulin-type fructans on the colon microbiota revealed that this effect is specifically associated to three genera, one of which (Bilophila) representing a promising novel target for mechanistic research."

To provide a basis for studying epigenome deregulation in CLL, we established genome-wide chromatin accessibility maps for 88 CLL samples from 55 patients using the ATAC-seq assay, and we also performed ChIPmentation and RNA-seq profiling for ten representative samples. Based on the resulting dataset, we devised and applied a bioinformatic method that links chromatin profiles to clinical annotations. Our analysis identified sample-specific variation on top of a shared core of CLL regulatory regions. IGHV mutation status – which distinguishes the two major subtypes of CLL – was accurately predicted by the chromatin profiles, and gene regulatory networks inferred for IGHV-mutated vs. IGHV-unmutated samples identified characteristic differences between these two disease subtypes. In summary, we discovered widespread heterogeneity in the chromatin landscape of CLL, established a community resource for studying epigenome deregulation in leukemia, and demonstrated the feasibility of chromatin accessibility mapping in cancer cohorts and clinical research."
EGAS00001001876,exome  rna sequencing  relapsed tcf3 pbx1 t 1 19 acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"TCF3-PBX1 (E2A-PBX1) is a recurrent gene fusion in B-cell precursor lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), which is caused by the translocation t(1;19)(q23;p13). TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL patients typically benefit from chemotherapy; however, many relapse and subsequently develop resistant disease with few effective treatment options. Mechanisms driving disease progression and therapy resistance have not been studied in TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL. Here, we aimed to identify novel treatment options for TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL by profiling leukemia cells from a relapsed patient, and determine molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis and progression. By drug sensitivity testing of leukemic blasts from the index patient, control samples and TCF3-PBX1 positive and negative BCP-ALL cell lines, we identified the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase delta (p110δ) inhibitor idelalisib as an effective treatment for TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL. This was further supported by evidence showing TCF3-PBX1 directly regulates expression of PIK3CD, the gene encoding p110δ. Other somatic mutations to TP53 and MTOR, as well as aberrant expression of CXCR4, may influence additional drug sensitivities specific to the index patient and accompanied progression of the disease. Our results suggest that idelalisib is a promising treatment option for patients with TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL while other drugs could be useful depending on the genetic context of individual patients."
EGAS00001003028, evolutionary history  human colitis associated colorectal cancer,"Inflammatory bowel disease confers an increased lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC), and colitis-associated CRC (CA-CRC) is molecularly distinct from sporadic CRC (S-CRC). Here we have dissected the evolutionary history of CA-CRC using multi-region sequencing.

Exome sequencing was performed on fresh-frozen multiple regions of carcinoma, adjacent non-cancerous mucosa and blood from 12 CA-CRC patients (n=55 exomes), and key variants were validated with orthogonal methods. Genome-wide copy number profiling was performed using SNP arrays and low-pass whole genome sequencing on archival non-dysplastic mucosa (n=9), low-grade dysplasia (LGD, n=30), high-grade dysplasia (HGD, n=13), mixed LGD/HGD (n=7) and CA-CRC (n=19). Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed, and evolutionary analysis used to reveal the temporal sequence of events leading to CA-CRC.

10/12 tumors were microsatellite stable with a median mutation burden of 3.0 single nucleotide alterations (SNAs) per Mb, around 20% higher than S-CRC (2.5 SNAs/Mb), and consistent with elevated aging-associated mutational processes. Non-dysplastic mucosa had considerable mutation burden (median 47 SNAs), including mutations shared with the neighboring CA-CRC, indicating a pre-cancer mutational field. CA-CRCs were often near-triploid (42%) or near-tetraploid (21%) and phylogenetic analysis revealed that copy number alterations (CNAs) began to accrue in non-dysplastic bowel, but the LGD/HGD transition often involved a punctuated catastrophic CNA increase."

Previous efforts to locate the Asian origin of Malagasy have highlighted Borneo broadly as a potential source, but so far no firm source populations have been identified. Here, we have generated genome-wide data from two Southeast Borneo populations, the Banjar and the Ngaju, together with published data compiled from populations across the Indian Ocean region. We find strong support for an origin of the Asian ancestry of Malagasy among the Banjar. This group emerged from the long-standing presence of a Malay Empire trading post in Southeast Borneo, which favoured admixture between the Malay and an autochthonous Borneo group, the Ma’anyan. Reconciling genetic, historical and linguistic data, we show that the Banjar, in Malay-led voyages, were the most probable Asian source among the analysed groups in the founding of the Malagasy gene pool."

Although previous studies have suggested that many of the molecular features of invasive breast cancer are established early, it is unclear what mechanisms drive progression, and whether the mechanisms of progression are dependent or independent of subtype. We have generated mRNA, miRNA and DNA copy number profiles from a total of 59 in situ lesions and 85 invasive tumors, in order to comprehensively identify those genes, signaling pathways, processes, and cell types that are involved in breast cancer progression. Our work provides evidence that there are molecular features associated with disease progression that are unique to the intrinsic subtypes. We additionally establish subtype-specific signatures that are able to identify a small proportion of pre-invasive tumors with expression profiles that resemble invasive carcinoma, indicating a higher likelihood of future disease progression."

We aim to stratify multifocal HCC and identify novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers by performing whole genome and transcriptome sequencing, as part of a multi-omics strategy Methods: A complete collection of tumour and somatic specimens (intrahepatic HCC lesions, matched non-cancerous liver tissue and blood) were obtained from representative patientswith multifocal HCC exhibiting two distinct postsurgical courses. Whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing with genotyping were performed for each tissue specimen to con-trast genomic alterations, including hepatitis B virus integrations, somatic mutations, copy number variations, and structural variations. We then constructed a phylogenetic tree to visualise individual tumour evolution and performed functional enrichment analyses on select differentially expressed genes to elucidate biological processes involved in multifocal HCC development. Multi-omics data were integrated with detailed clinicopathological information to identify HCC biomarkers, which were further validated using a large cohort of HCC patients (n = 174).Results: The multi-omics proﬁling and tumour biomarkers could successfully distinguish the two multifocal HCC types, while accurately predicting clonality and aggressiveness. The dual speciﬁcity protein kinase TTK, which is a key mitotic checkpoint regulator with links to p53 signaling, was further shown to be a promising overall prognostic marker for HCC in the large patient cohort.Conclusions: Comprehensive multi-omics characterisation of multifocal tumour evolution may improve clinical decision-making, facilitate personalised medicine, and expedite identiﬁcation of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in HCC."

Here in Phase I of this study, we perform exome sequencing on baseline, surgical core-cuts and blood from 60 patients (40 AI treated, 20 Controls). In poor responders (based on Ki67 change) we find significantly more somatic mutations than good responders. Subclones exclusive to baseline or surgical cores   occur in approximately 30% of tumours. In Phase II we combine targeted sequencing on another 28 treated patients with Phase I. We find six genes frequently mutated: PIK3CA, TP53, CDH1, MLL3, ABCA13 and FLG with 71% concordance between paired cores. TP53 mutations are associated with poor response. We conclude that multiple biopsies are essential for confident mutational profiling of ER+ breast cancer and TP53 mutations are associated with resistance to oestrogen deprivation therapy."

EGAS00001002102,tracing  origin  disseminated tumor cells  breast cancer  single cell sequencing,"Background 
Single-cell micro-metastases of solid tumors often occur in the bone marrow. These disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) may resist therapy and lay dormant or progress to cause overt bone and visceral metastases. The molecular nature of DTCs remains elusive, as well as when and from where in the tumor they originate. Here, we apply single-cell sequencing to identify and trace the origin of DTCs in breast cancer. 

Results 
We sequence the genomes of 63 single cells isolated from six non-metastatic breast cancer patients. By comparing the cells DNA copy number aberration (CNA) landscapes with those of the primary tumors and lymph node metastasis, we establish that 53% of the single cells morphologically classified as tumor cells are DTCs disseminating from the observed tumor. The remaining cells represent either non-aberrant ‘normal’ cells or aberrant cells of unknown origin that have CNA landscapes discordant from the tumor. Further analyses suggest that the prevalence of aberrant cells of unknown origin is age-dependent, and that at least a subset is hematopoietic in origin. Evolutionary reconstruction analysis of bulk tumor and DTC genomes enables ordering of CNA events in molecular pseudo-time and traced the origin of the DTCs to either the main tumor clone, primary tumor subclones, or subclones in an axillary lymph node metastasis. 

Conclusions 
Single-cell sequencing of bone marrow epithelial-like cells, in parallel with intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity profiling from bulk DNA, is a powerful approach to identify and study DTCs, yielding insight into metastatic processes. A heterogeneous population of CNA-positive cells is present in the bone marrow of non-metastatic breast cancer patients, only part of which are derived from the observed tumor lineages."

Increased expression of CRLF2, the receptor to thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) characterizes about half of DS-ALLs and also a subgroup of sporadic “Philadelphia-like ALLs”. To understand the pathogenesis of relapsed DS-ALL we performed integrative genomic analysis of 25 matched diagnosis remission and relapse DS-ALLs.  We found that the CRLF2 rearrangements are early events during DS-ALL evolution and generally stable between diagnoses and relapse. Secondary activating signaling events in JAK-STAT/RAS pathway were ubiquitous but highly redundant between diagnosis and relapse, suggesting that signaling is essential but that no specific mutations are “relapse driving”. We further found that activated JAK2 may be naturally suppressed in 25% of CRLF2 positive DS-ALL by loss-of-function aberrations in USP9X, a deubuitinase previously shown to stabilize the activated phosphorylated JAK2. Interrogation of large ALL genomic databases extended our findings up to 25% of CRLF2 positive, “Ph like” ALLs. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of USP9X as well as treatment with low-dose Ruxolitinib enhanced the survival of pre-B ALL cells overexpressing mutated JAK2. Thus, somehow counterintuitive, we found that suppression of JAK-STAT “hyper-signaling” may be beneficial to leukemic B cell precursors. This and the reduction of JAK mutated clones at relapse suggest that the therapeutic effect of JAK specific inhibitors may be limited. Rather, combined signaling inhibitors or direct targeting of the TSLP receptor may be a useful therapeutic strategy for DS-ALL."

However, some will go on to develop progressive disease that is not amenable to further surgery and/or not responsive to RAI. Currently, there are no clinical or molecular diagnostic tools to predict recurrence and aggressiveness of a subset of PTC. We aim to analyze the genomic DNA sequences of 500 thyroid cancers and the corresponding DNA from blood. With the goal of a better understanding the pathobiology of thyroid carcinogenesis we will use state of the art ""deep sequencing"" technology to decipher the molecular and genetic signature of Saudi PTC. The development of next-generation (NextGen) sequencing technologies has spurred high hopes for the identification of novel biomarkers for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction, including thyroid cancer.  Our objectives will be achieved through the following aims: the studies of specific aim 1 will be the generation of comprehensive catalogues of genomic abnormalities (somatic mutations) in thyroid cancer of the papillary thyroid carcinoma histology subtype which is of clinical and social importance in Saudi Arabia. Specific aim 2 will catalogue for each papillary thyroid carcinoma to include the full range of somatic mutations including single-nucleotide variants, insertions, deletions, copy number changes, translocations and other chromosomal rearrangements. Specific aim 3 will generate complementary catalogues of transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets from selected tumor cases that demonstrate abnormalities from aim 1 and 2.  The outcome of this study will provide a better understanding of PTC and should have important clinical implications, as it could result in the development of new and better strategies for targeted therapeutic intervention for the treatment of Saudi Arabian PTC tumors."
EGAS00001002874,foundation medicine genomic data   identify prognostic markers  fusion genes  multiple myeloma,"The purpose of this study is to identify prognostic markers and treatment targets using a clinically certified sequencing panel in multiple myeloma.  Mutational burden was associated with maf and proliferation gene expression groups, and a high-mutational burden was associated with a poor prognosis. We identified homozygous deletions that were present in multiple myeloma within key genes, including CDKN2C, RB1, TRAF3, BIRC3 and TP53, and that bi-allelic inactivation was significantly enriched at relapse. Alterations in CDKN2C, TP53, RB1 and the t(4;14) were associated with poor prognosis. Alterations in RB1 were predominantly homozygous deletions and were associated with relapse and a poor prognosis which was independent of other genetic markers, including t(4;14), after multivariate analysis. Bi-allelic inactivation of key tumor suppressor genes in myeloma was enriched at relapse, especially in RB1, CDKN2C and TP53 where they have prognostic significance.

In addition, chromosomal rearrangements that result in oncogenic kinase activation are present in many solid and hematological malignancies, but none have been reported in multiple myeloma (MM). Here we detected fusion genes in 1.5% of patients.  These fusion genes were in-frame and the majority of them contained kinase domains from either receptor tyrosine kinases (ALK, ROS1, NTRK3, and FGFR1) or cytoplasmic kinases (BRAF, MAP3K14, and MAPK14) which would result in the activation of MEK/ERK, NF-κB or inflammatory signaling pathways. Fusion genes were present in smoldering MM, newly diagnosed MM and relapse patient samples indicating they are not solely late events. Most fusion genes were subclonal in nature, but one EML4-ALK fusion was clonal indicating it is a driver of disease pathogenesis. Samples with fusions of receptor tyrosine kinases were not found in conjunction with clonal Ras/Raf mutations indicating a parallel mechanism of MEK/ERK pathway activation. Fusion genes involving MAP3K14 (NIK), which regulates the NF-κB pathway, were detected as were t(14;17) rearrangements involving NIK in 2% of MM samples. Activation of kinases in myeloma through rearrangements presents an opportunity to use treatments existing in other cancers."

Still, however, metastasis is the major clinically unmet problem, also due to an incomplete understanding of its molecular evolution.This study is the first to define the metastasis-specific whole genome landscape of human colorectal primary vs. matched metastatic lesions.Protein coding, ncRNA genes and 3’UTRs harbored about a third each of single nucleotide variations (SNVs)/indels, 19% of them being metastasis-specific. We found novel mutational hills among ncRNAs and 3’UTRs, copy number changes able to explain changes in microRNA expression in metastases, and novel metastasis-specific mutations in the 3’UTRs on important cancer signalling genes. Some metastatic lesions showed targetable mutations not detected in the primaries. Analysis of mutual exclusivity patterns supported a model that has progressive alterations in important colorectal cancer genes and revealed new partners. Metastatic lesions were enriched in SNVs, specific structural variations, and alterations in genes affecting cell adhesion and extracellular matrix interaction.Furthermore, a hepatic stellate activation cascade was enriched in metastases, suggesting genetic programs for site-specific colonization. Allele frequency distribution and mutational signature analysis suggests a common ancestor clone to both the primary tumor and the metastasis, with additional mutagenesis ongoing in both sites independently. Taken together, our results significantly add to hypothesis generation on metastasis evolution, and suggest novel metastasis-specific genomic changes which would be missed by current personalized therapy concepts.

In high Teff tumors, concomitant high myeloid inflammation was associated with worse PFS in the atezolizumab monotherapy arm; adding bevacizumab to atezolizumab in this subgroup improved PFS vs atezolizumab. Molecular profiles suggest that prediction of outcomes with VEGF inhibitors and immunotherapy may be possible in mRCC, and bevacizumab may overcome myeloid inflammation-associated atezolizumab resistance."

EGAS00001003027,allele balance bias identifies systematic genotyping errors  false disease associations,"In recent years, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has become a cornerstone of clinical genetics and diagnostics. Many clinical applications require high precision, especially if rare events such as somatic mutations in cancer or genetic variants causing rare diseases need to be identified. Although random sequencing errors can be modeled statistically and deep sequencing minimizes their impact, systematic errors remain a problem even at high depth of coverage. Understanding their source is crucial to increase precision of clinical NGS applications. In this work, we studied the relation between recurrent biases in allele balance (AB), systematic errors and false positive variant calls across a large cohort of human samples analyzed by whole exome sequencing (WES). We have modeled the allele balance distribution for biallelic genotypes in 987 WES samples in order to identify positions recurrently deviating significantly from the expectation, a phenomenon we termed allele balance bias (ABB). Furthermore, we have developed a genotype callability score based on ABB for all positions of the human exome, which detects false positive variant calls that passed state-of-the-art filters. Finally, we demonstrate the use of ABB for detection of false associations proposed by rare variant association studies (RVAS)."
EGAS00001002707,sequencing based counting  size profiling  plasma epstein barr virus dna enhance population screening  nasopharyngeal carcinoma,"Circulating tumor-derived DNA testing for cancer screening has recently been demonstrated in a prospective study on identification of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) among 20,174 asymptomatic individuals. Plasma EBV DNA, a marker for NPC, was detected using real-time PCR. While plasma EBV DNA was persistently detectable in 97.1% of the NPCs identified, ∼5% of the general population had transiently detectable plasma EBV DNA. We hypothesized that EBV DNA in plasma of subjects with or without NPC may have different molecular characteristics. We performed target-capture sequencing of plasma EBV DNA and identified differences in the abundance and size profiles of EBV DNA molecules within plasma of NPC and non-NPC subjects. NPC patients had significantly higher amounts of plasma EBV DNA, which showed longer fragment lengths. Cutoff values were established from an exploratory dataset and tested in a validation sample set. Adopting an algorithm that required a sample to concurrently pass cutoffs for EBV DNA counting and size measurements, NPCs were detected at a positive predictive value (PPV) of 19.6%. This represented superior performance compared with the PPV of 11.0% in the prospective screening study, which required participants with an initially detectable plasma EBV DNA result to be retested within 4 weeks. The observed differences in the molecular nature of EBV DNA molecules in plasma of subjects with or without NPC were successfully translated into a sequencing-based test that had a high PPV for NPC screening and achievable through single time-point testing."

EGAS00001002184,mir 200 regulated cxcl12 promotes fibroblast heterogeneity  immunosuppression  ovarian cancers,"High-grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer (HGSOC) has been recently subdivided into molecular subgroups, including the mesenchymal HGSOC associated with partial tumor-debulking surgery and poor patient survival. Consistent with stromal-related genes signatures defining mesenchymal HGSOC, we show here that stroma plays a key function in this HGSOC molecular subtype. We first highlight stromal heterogeneity in HGSOC by identifying 4 subsets of Carcinoma-Associated Fibroblast (CAF-S1-4). Mesenchymal HGSOC significantly accumulate the activated CAF-S1 subset, which exhibits immunosuppressive functions by promoting attraction, survival and activation of regulatory T-lymphocytes. The CXCL12β chemokine reliably characterizes mesenchymal HGSOC and specifically accumulates in the CAF-S1 subset through a regulation mediated by the miR-141/200a. CXCL12β promotes attraction of T-lymphocytes and is thus a key actor in CAF-S1-mediated immunosuppressive functions. In conclusion, we highlight here for the first time stromal heterogeneity and immunosuppression in mesenchymal HGSOC that could participate in the poor patient prognosis."

We show that Myc expression cooperates with Rb1 and Trp53 loss in the mouse lung to promote aggressive, highly metastatic tumors, that are initially sensitive to chemotherapy followed by relapse, similar to human SCLC. Importantly, MYC drives a neuroendocrine-low “variant” subset of SCLC with high NEUROD1 expression corresponding to transcriptional profiles of human SCLC. Targeted drug screening reveals that SCLC with high MYC expression is vulnerable to Aurora kinase inhibition, which combined with chemotherapy strongly suppresses tumor progression and increases survival. These data identify molecular features for patient stratification and uncover a novel targeted treatment approach for MYC-driven SCLC."
EGAS00001002149,rna sequencing   pilocytic astrocytoma tumors,"Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) is the most common pediatric brain tumor. A recurrent feature of PA is deregulation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway most often through KIAA1549-BRAF fusion, but also by other BRAF- or RAF1-gene fusions and point mutations (e.g. BRAFV600E). These features may serve as diagnostic and prognostic markers, and also facilitate development of targeted therapy. The aim of this study was to characterize the genetic alterations underlying the development of PA tumor in six cases, and evaluate methods for fusion oncogene detection. Using a combined analysis of RNA sequencing and copy number variation data we identified a new BRAF fusion involving the 5’ gene fusion partner GTF2I (7q11.23), not previously described in PA. The novel GTF2I-BRAF 19-10 fusion was found in one case, while the other five cases harbored the frequent KIAA1549-BRAF 16-9 fusion gene. Comparing fusion detection methods, Fluorescence in situ hybridization with BRAF break apart probe was the most sensitive method for detection of the two different BRAF rearrangements (GTF2I-BRAF and KIAA1549-BRAF). Our finding of a novel BRAF fusion in PA further emphasis the important role of B-Raf in tumorigenesis of these tumor types. Also, the growing list of BRAF/RAF gene fusions suggests these to be informative tumor markers in molecular diagnostics, which could guide future treatment strategies."

To address this issue, 60x whole genome sequencing of 26 metastases from 4 patients was carried out.  We found that the identical driver gene mutations were present in every metastatic lesion of each patient studied. Passenger gene mutations not known or predicted to have functional consequences accounted for all intratumoral heterogeneity. Even with respect to these passenger gene mutations, the genetic similarity among the founding cells of metastases was markedly higher than that expected for any two cells randomly taken from a normal tissue.  The uniformity of driver gene mutations among metastases in the same patient has critical, encouraging implications for the success of future targeted therapies in advanced stage disease."
EGAS00001002170,scalable  genome single cell library preparation  pre amplification,"Single-cell genomics is critical for understanding cellular heterogeneity in cancer, but existing library preparation methods are expensive, require sample preamplification and introduce coverage bias. Here we describe direct library preparation (DLP), a robust, scalable, and high-fidelity method that uses nanoliter-volume transposition reactions for single-cell whole-genome library preparation without preamplification. We examined 782 cells from cell lines and triple-negative breast xenograft tumors. Low-depth sequencing, compared with existing methods, revealed greater coverage uniformity and more reliable detection of copy-number alterations. Using phylogenetic analysis, we found minor xenograft subpopulations that were undetectable by bulk sequencing, as well as dynamic clonal expansion and diversification between passages. Merging single-cell genomes in silico, we generated ""bulk-equivalent"" genomes with high depth and uniform coverage. Thus, low-depth sequencing of DLP libraries may provide an attractive replacement for conventional bulk sequencing methods, permitting analysis of copy number at the cell level and of other genomic variants at the population level."
EGAS0000000122,metabric mirna landscape,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key players in cancer pathogenesis1. They display differential expression across breast cancer subtypes, and play oncogenic and tumor-suppressive roles2-6. A systematic study of the global miRNA landscape in breast cancer and the factors shaping it has not been undertaken. Here we report the results of profiling miRNA expression in 1,302 breast tumors with detailed clinical annotation and long-term follow-up, and for which matching genomic and mRNA expression data were available7. This provides a comprehensive view of the quantity, distribution and variation of the miRNA population and dissects how much genomic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional events contribute to miRNA expression architecture. The key clinical parameters and cellular pathways related to the miRNA landscape are identified, exemplified by context-dependent interaction with cell adhesion and Wnt signaling. Strikingly, in breast cancer miRNAs appear to act as modulators of mRNA-mRNA interactions rather than molecular switches. We demonstrate an important modulatory role for miRNAs in the biology of breast tumors devoid of somatic copy number aberrations, a common subtype where immune response is prominent. Remarkably, prognostic miRNA signatures derived in this subtype are consistently prognostic across several other subtypes and validate in external cohorts. These findings represent a new framework to study the biology of miRNA in human cancer.

Herein, we present detailed analyses of this dataset using HaplotypeCaller and MuTect2 through the Broad Institute’s Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK). We also present comparisons of the ability to detect TP53 mutation by MPS and Sanger sequencing in these tumors.

EGAS00001002441,successful immune checkpoint blockade   patient  advanced stage microsatellite unstable biliary tract cancer h021,"Cancers acquire multiple somatic mutations that can lead to the generation of immunogenic mutation-induced neoantigens. These neoantigens can be recognized by the host’s immune system. However, continuous stimulation of immune cells against tumor antigens can lead to immune cell exhaustion, which allows uncontrolled outgrowth of tumor cells. Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors have emerged as a novel approach to overcome immune cell exhaustion and re-activate anti-tumor immune responses. In particular, antibodies blocking the exhaustion-mediating programmed death receptor (PD-1)/PD-L1 pathway have shown clinical efficacy. The effects were particularly pronounced in tumors with DNA mismatch repair deficiency and a high mutational load, which typically occur in the colon and  endometrium. Here, we report on a 24-year old woman diagnosed with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma who showed strong and durable response to the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab, although treatment was initiated at an advanced stage of disease. The patient’s tumor displayed DNA mismatch repair deficiency and microsatellite instability (MSI), but lacked other features commonly discussed as predictors of response towards checkpoint blockade, such as PD-L1 expression or dense infiltration with cytotoxic T cells. Notably, high levels of HLA class I and II antigen expression were detected in the tumor, suggesting a potential causal relation between functionality of the tumor’s antigen presentation machinery and the success of immune checkpoint blockade. We suggest determining MSI status in combination with HLA class I and II antigen expression in tumors potentially eligible for immune checkpoint blockade even in the absence of conventional markers predictive for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and in entities not commonly linked to MSI phenotype. Further studies are required to determine the value of these markers for predicting the success of immune checkpoint blockade.  (H021)"

Several populations in present-day Pakistan and India are thought to be the descendants of such slaves, yet their genetic ancestries and history of admixture and natural selection remain largely undefined. Here we studied the genome-wide diversity of the African-descent Makranis, residing on the Arabian Sea coast of Pakistan, together with that of four neighboring Pakistani populations, to investigate the genetic legacy, population dynamics and tempo of the Indian Ocean slave trade. We show that the Makranis result from an admixture event between local Baluch tribes and Bantu-speaking populations from eastern/southeastern Africa, which we dated to ~300 years ago during the Omani Empire domination. Levels of inbreeding, measured through cumulative runs of homozygosity, were found to be similar across Pakistani populations, suggesting that the admixed Makranis rapidly adopted the traditional practice of endogamous marriages. Finally, we searched for signatures of post-admixture selection at several traits evolving under positive selection, including skin color, lactase persistence and resistance to malaria. We demonstrate that the African-specific Duffy-null blood group — believed to confer resistance against Plasmodium vivax infection — was recently introduced to Pakistan through the slave trade and evolved under positive selection in this vivax malaria-endemic region. Collectively, our study reconstructs the genetic and adaptive history of a neglected episode of the African Diaspora, and illustrates the impact of recent admixture on the diffusion of adaptive traits across human populations."

EGAS00001002616,breast cancer women lack normal lifelong immune response  full term pregnancies,"Immunological tolerance during pregnancy is necessary for women’s bodies to accept the semi-allogenic fetus. Interestingly, “immune evasion”, which consists of some similar immunological changes, was recently proposed as a hallmark of cancer. Looking at these results, it seems paradoxical that increasing number of full-term pregnancies (FTP) reduces the risk of breast cancer in women. Our aim was to use a systems epidemiology approach to investigate this paradox by modelling breast cancer incidence as a function of parity in the Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) cohort, then testing the mathematical model using gene expression from blood in a subcohort of these women: the NOWAC postgenome cohort. Lastly, we undertook a gene set enrichment analysis for immunological gene sets. A linear trend nicely fitted the dataset showing an 8% decrease in risk for each FTP, independent of stratification on other risk factors and lasting for decades after a woman’s last FTP. However, when we looked at gene expression we found that hundreds of genes showed linear trends in cancer-free controls, but this was not the case in /any/ of the samples from breast cancer cases. In the gene set enrichment analysis, samples consisted of human blood or cord blood and mouse bone marrow or spleen. We found more adaptive gene sets than expected in humans and more innate gene sets than expected in mice. None of the gene sets provided information about the long-term effects of immunological tolerance during pregnancy, but the lack of relevant reductionist experiments hampers our interpretation. We suggest that, after resolution at birth, the immunological tolerance induced by pregnancy augments immune response to cancer development."
EGAS00001002627,ultra fast patient derived xenografts identify functional  spatial tumour heterogeneities  drive therapeutic resistance,"Treatment of patients with advanced cancers increasingly relies on agents targeting specific molecular or cellular aberrations. These expensive therapies often fail because of pre-existing drug resistance. Intra-tumoural molecular and micro-environmental heterogeneity resistance can create resistance in one or more subclones of a tumour, leading to spatio-functional heterogeneity. We created a rapid approach for quantifying tumour functional phenotypes based on tumour-implantation into the chorioallantoic membrane of chick embryos. We apply this technique to 43 separate biopsies from 6 patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with 36 replicates per biopsy, achieving a 93.6% engraftment rate (1449/1548). Challenging these models with sunitinib, an anti-angiogenic therapy frequently used in RCC allowed us to quantify spatio-functional heterogeneity in individual patients. Prediction of de novo drug resistance in advanced cancer patients would facilitate precision medicine by tailoring systemic therapies and improve clinical trial design outcome measures. We describe a patient-derived xenograft platform where fresh patient tumour samples are implanted into the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of chick embryos at high engraftment efficiencies, permitting large scale “tumour avatar” studies to guide the selection of drugs and to predict clinical drug resistance outcomes in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients. Applying this “tumour avatar” model in a co-clinical trial on RCC patients, we observe intra-tumoural functional heterogeneity with sunitinib treatment, revealing the presence of drug-resistant clones prior to the initiation of therapy. Multi-regional exome Matched DNA sequencing of the primary tumour and metastases revealed DNA mutational signatures associated with sunitinib resistance at baseline and after treatment.

Whole transcriptome RNA-seq was performed at 7 developmental stages: definitive endoderm, primitive gut tube, posterior foregut (PF), pancreatic endoderm, endocrine progenitors, endocrine-like cells, and beta-like cells (BLC). Differentially-expressed (ΔExp) genes were assigned to the stage in which they were most upregulated (versus baseline iPSC profile), and used to assess the enrichment of T2D GWAS genes, as well as to predict the upstream transcription factors at each developmental stage.We found 9409 ΔExp genes across all stages, including known markers of islet development (NEUROG3, INS). Genes ΔExp in the most-differentiated (BLC) stage were significantly enriched for genes within the 99% credible sets of T2D GWAS loci. Despite this enrichment in BLC only, over 70% of genes mapping within the credible sets were ΔExp before this stage, highlighting the relevance of key T2D GWAS genes in islet development: e.g. expression of TCF7L2 peaked during the PF stage (log2FC=1.2; q=8.5×10-10). REST and LMNA are also highlighted by the analyses as having a potential function in islet development, considering their pattern of expression and those of the genes they regulate. Transcriptomic signatures derived from this iPSC differentiation model highlight T2D-associated GWAS loci, monogenic diabetes genes and potential master regulators of gene networks with plausible function in islet development.

Although these features hint at a role of lncRNAs in β cell gene regulation and diabetes, the function of β cell lncRNAs remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the function of β cell-specific lncRNAs and transcription factors using transcript knockdowns and co-expression network analysis. This revealed lncRNAs that function in concert with transcription factors to regulate β cell-specific transcriptional networks. We further demonstrate that the lncRNA PLUTO affects local 3D chromatin structure and transcription of PDX1, encoding a key β cell transcription factor, and that both PLUTO and PDX1 are downregulated in islets from donors with type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. These results implicate lncRNAs in the regulation of β cell-specific transcription factor networks."

Taking advantage of multi-level genomic analysis, here we studied the genetic basis of human short-term (STM, n=1,620) and long-term (LTM, n=1,526) memory functions. Heritability estimation based on single nucleotide polymorphism showed moderate heritability of short-term memory but very low heritability of long-term memory. In a two-step genome-wide association study, the markers rs13151012 and rs1558360 passed genome-wide significance (p &lt; 5×10-8) in digit-span STM task and for the first principal component shared by two STM tasks; however, none of them survived the replication. In turn, we selected the ten most significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for replication tests.

Furthermore, we performed a pathway analysis based on the current genomic data and found six pathways significantly associated with STM capacity and one pathway associated with LTM capacity."

EGAS00001000610,rna sequencing  illumina 2 5m snp array data collected  675 commonly  human cancer cell lines,"Tumor-derived cell lines have served as vital models to advance our understanding of oncogene function and therapeutic response1. Although substantial effort has been directed to defining the genomic constitution of cancer cell line panels2–4, the transcriptome – which represents the active program of a cell – remains understudied. Here, we describe RNA sequencing and SNP array analysis of 675 commonly used human cancer cell lines. We explore numerous transcriptome features including coding and non-coding gene expression, transcribed mutations, gene fusion and expression of non-human sequences. Aside from many known aberrations we find new surprising characteristics, including more than 2200 unique fusion gene pairs representing a vast, testable repertoire of oncogenic fusions, many of which have analogs found in primary human tumors. We show that a combination of multiple genome and transcriptome features in a novel pathway-based approach enhances prediction of response to various targeted therapeutics. Our results provide valuable new insights into these critical pre-clinical models and provide added context for interpreting the numerous studies that employ these widely used cell lines."
EGAS00001000708,integrative genomic profiling  large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas reveals distinct subtypes  high grade neuroendocrine lung tumors,"Large-cell neuroendocrine lung carcinomas (LCNEC) have similarities with other lung cancers, but their precise relationship has remained unclear. We conducted comprehensive genomic (n=60) and transcriptomic (n=69) analyses of 75 LCNECs and identified two molecular subgroups: “type I LCNECs” with bi-allelic TP53 and STK11/KEAP1 alterations (37%), and “type II LCNECs” enriched for bi-allelic inactivation of TP53 and RB1 (42%). Despite sharing genomic alterations with adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, no transcriptional relationship was found; instead LCNECs form distinct transcriptional subgroups with closest similarity to SCLC. While type I LCNECs and SCLCs exhibit a neuroendocrine profile with ASCL1high/DLL3high/NOTCHlow, type II LCNECs bear TP53 and RB1 alterations and differ from most SCLC tumors with reduced neuroendocrine markers, a pattern of ASCL1low/DLL3low/NOTCHhigh and upregulation of immune-related pathways. In conclusion, LCNECs are comprised of two molecularly defined subgroups, and distinguishing them from SCLC may allow for stratified targeted treatments for high-grade neuroendocrine lung tumors."
EGAS00001001746,drug perturbation based stratification  blood cancer,"As new generations of targeted therapies emerge and tumor genome sequencing discovers increasingly comprehensive mutation repertoires, the functional relationships of mutations to tumor phenotypes remain largely unknown. Here, we measured ex vivo sensitivity of 246 blood cancers to 63 drugs alongside genome, transcriptome, and DNA methylome analysis to understand determinants of drug response. We assembled a primary blood cancer cell encyclopedia data set that revealed disease-specific sensitivities for each cancer. Within chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), responses to 62% of drugs were associated with 2 or more mutations, and linked the B cell receptor (BCR) pathway to trisomy 12, an important driver of CLL. Based on drug responses, the disease could be organized into phenotypic subgroups characterized by exploitable dependencies on BCR, mTOR, or MEK signaling and associated with mutations, gene expression, and DNA methylation. Fourteen percent of CLLs were driven by mTOR signaling in a non–BCR-dependent manner. Multivariate modeling revealed immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene (IGHV) mutation status and trisomy 12 as the most important modulators of response to kinase inhibitors in CLL. Ex vivo drug responses were associated with outcome. This study overcomes the perception that most mutations do not influence drug response of cancer, and points to an updated approach to understanding tumor biology, with implications for biomarker discovery and cancer care."
EGAS00001002377,tumor derived exosomes modulate pd l1 expression  monocytes,"In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), monocytes and macrophages are skewed toward protumorigenic phenotypes, including the release of tumor-supportive cytokines and the expression of immunosuppressive molecules such as programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1). To understand the mechanism driving protumorigenic skewing in CLL, we evaluated the role of tumor cell–derived exosomes in the cross-talk with monocytes. We carried out RNA sequencing and proteome analyses of CLL-derived exosomes and identified noncoding Y RNA hY4 as a highly abundant RNA species that is enriched in exosomes from plasma of CLL patients compared with healthy donor samples. Transfer of CLL-derived exosomes or hY4 alone to monocytes resulted in key CLL-associated phenotypes, including the release of cytokines, such as C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL4, and interleukin-6, and the expression of PD-L1. These responses were abolished in Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7)–deficient monocytes, suggesting exosomal hY4 as a driver of TLR7 signaling. Pharmacologic inhibition of endosomal TLR signaling resulted in a substantially reduced activation of monocytes in vitro and attenuated CLL development in vivo. Our results indicate that exosome-mediated transfer of noncoding RNAs to monocytes contributes to cancer-related inflammation and concurrent immune escape via PD-L1 expression."
EGAS00001001953,comprehensive molecular profiling identifies novel genetic drivers  subtypes underlying medulloblastoma,"Current therapies for medulloblastoma (MB), a highly malignant childhood brain tumor, impose debilitating effects on the developing child, warranting the development of molecularly targeted treatments with reduced toxicities. Prior studies have failed to disclose the full spectrum of driver genes and molecular processes operative in MB or adequately explain heterogeneity among molecular subgroups. Herein, we detail the somatic landscape across 491 sequenced MBs and molecular heterogeneity amongst 1,256 epigenetically analyzed cases, identifying subgroup-specific mutational signatures, driver genes, and pathway alterations including previously unappreciated actionable therapeutic targets. Integrative approaches for assigning driver genes to subgroups explained &gt;65-70% of Group 3 and Group 4, doubling previous knowledge. Novel subtypes underlying Group 3 and Group 4 were differentially enriched for specific driver events, including hotspot in-frame indels targeting KBTBD4 and ‘enhancer hijacking’ driving activation of PRDM6. Thus, application of integrative genomics to an unprecedented cohort of clinical samples derived from a single childhood cancer entity has disclosed a series of new cancer genes and biologically relevant subtype diversity that represent attractive therapeutic targets for treating MB."

HCFC1 is a transcriptional co-regulator, which interacts with transcription factors to regulate the expression of a myriad of genes. Notably, HCFC1 regulates cobalamin metabolism via the regulation of MMACHC expression through its interaction with THAP11, a THAP domain-containing transcription factor. In addition, the HCFC1/THAP11 complex potentially regulates genes involved in diverse cellular functions including cell cycle, proliferation, and transcription. Thus, it is likely that mutations in THAP11 may also result in biochemical and other phenotypes similar to those observed in patients with cblX. We report a patient who presented with phenotypic features that overlap cblX, but did not have any mutations in either MMACHC or HCFC1. We sequenced THAP11 by Sanger sequencing and discovered a potentially pathogenic, homozygous variant in THAP11, c.240C&gt;G (p.Phe80Leu). Functional analysis in the developing zebrafish embryo, demonstrate that both THAP11 and HCFC1 regulate the proliferation and differentiation of neural precursors, suggesting important roles in normal brain development. Further, the loss of THAP11 in zebrafish embryos, results in craniofacial abnormalities including the complete loss of Meckel’s cartilage, the ceratohyal, and all of the ceratobranchial cartilages. These data are consistent with our previous work which demonstrated a role for HCFC1 in vertebrate craniofacial development. Furthermore, our high throughput RNA-sequencing analysis reveals several overlapping gene targets of HCFC1 and THAP11 that likely contribute to the phenotypes associated with cblX and related disorders. Thus, both HCFC1 and THAP11 play important roles in the regulation of cobalamin metabolism as well as other pathways involved in early vertebrate development."

Clonal heterogeneity has recently been established as a feature in MM, however, the subclonal evolution associated with disease progression has not been described. We used whole exome sequencing to analyse 10 paired patient samples, providing new insights into the progression from Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) and Smouldering MM (SMM), to symptomatic MM. We confirm that clonal heterogeneity is a common feature at diagnosis and that the driving events involved in disease progression are more complex than previously reported. While we observe some previously identified known “drivers” of MM, we find that the driving events involved in progression are complex and not limited to the known SNVs or CNVs. The RAS/MAPK pathway was found to be the most frequently deregulated pathway, with recurrent mutations in KRAS and NRAS observed in patients at both MGUS/SMM and MM stages. We reveal that MM evolution is mainly characterised by the phenomenon of clonal stability, where the subclonal plasma cell populations identified at MM progression are already present in the asymptomatic MGUS/SMM stages. These subclonal populations could be amenable to therapeutic intervention to arrest transformation to MM."

EGAS00001003177, single complex agpat2 allele   patient  partial lipodystrophy,"Genetic lipodystrophies are a group of rare syndromes associated with major metabolic complications - including severe insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertriglyceridemia - which are classified according to the distribution of adipose tissue. Lipodystrophies can be present at birth or develop during life and can range from local to partial and general. With at least 18 different genes implicated so far, definite diagnosis can be challenging due to clinical and genetic heterogeneity. In an adult female patient with clinical and metabolic features of partial lipodystrophy we identified via whole genome sequencing a single complex AGPAT2 allele [V67M;V167A], functionally equivalent to heterozygosity. AGPAT2 encodes for an acyltransferase implicated in the biosynthesis of triacylglycerol and glycerophospholipids. So far homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in AGPAT2 have only been associated with generalized lipodystrophy. A SNP risk score analysis indicated that the index patient is not predisposed to lipodystrophy based on her genetic background. The partial phenotype in our patient is therefore more likely associated to the genetic variants in AGPAT2. To test whether the resulting double-mutant AGPAT2 protein is functional we analysed its in vitro enzymatic activity via mass spectrometry.  The resulting AGPAT2 double mutant is enzymatically inactive. Our data support the view that the current classification of lipodystrophies as strictly local, partial or generalized may have to be re-evaluated and viewed more as a continuum, both in terms of clinical presentation and underlying genetic causes. Better molecular understanding of lipodystrophies may lead to new therapies to treat adipose tissue dysfunction in common and rare diseases."

EGAS00001002681,genome wide mutational consequences  nucleotide excision repair deficiency  xpc deletion   human adult stem cell culture,"Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is one of the main DNA repair pathways that protect cells against genomic damage. Deficiency in this pathway can contribute to the development of cancer and accelerate aging. NER-deficiency is an important determinant for cancer treatment outcome, as NER-deficient tumors are selectively sensitive to cisplatin treatment. While NER-deficiency has been linked to mutational Signature 5, not all NER-deficient tumors are characterized by a high Signature 5 contribution, illustrating the importance to further characterize the mutational consequences of NER-deficiency. Here, we analyzed the mutational profile of a human adult stem cell (organoid) culture that is deficient in NER through XPC deletion by CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing, and subsequent whole-genome sequencing analysis of a clonally derived organoid. We found that XPC deletion results in an increase in base substitution load and specifically induces Signature 8 mutations, a mutational signature with previously unknown etiology. Presence of Signature 8 may, therefore, serve as a novel biomarker for NER-deficient tumors and could improve personalized treatment strategies."

The indigenous Bajau people (“Sea Nomads”) of Southeast Asia live a subsistence lifestyle based on breath-hold diving and are renowned for their extraordinary breath holding abilities. However, it is unknown whether this has a genetic basis. Using a comparative genomic study, we show that natural selection on genetic variants in the PDE10A gene have increased spleen size in the Bajau, providing them with a larger reservoir of oxygenated red blood cells. We also find evidence of strong natural selection specific to the Bajau on BDKRB2, a gene affecting the human diving reflex. Thus, the Bajau, and possibly other natural diving populations, provide a new opportunity to study human adaptation to hypoxia tolerance."

Cohesin frequently colocalizes with CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor), affecting genomic stability, expression and epigenetic homeostasis. Cohesin subunits are mutated in cancer, but CTCF/cohesin-binding sites (CBSs) in DNA have not been examined for mutations. Here we report frequent mutations at CBSs in cancers displaying a mutational signature where mutations in A•T base pairs predominate. Integration of whole-genome sequencing data from 213 colorectal cancer (CRC) samples and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-exo) data identified frequent point mutations at CBSs. In contrast, CRCs showing an ultramutator phenotype caused by defects in the exonuclease domain of DNA polymerase ɛ (POLE) displayed significantly fewer mutations at and adjacent to CBSs. Analysis of public data showed that multiple cancer types accumulate CBS mutations. CBSs are a major mutational hotspot in the noncoding cancer genome."

The underlying disease is a plasma cell disorder, but limited whole exome data are available. We report the findings of an exome sequencing study in AL to define a plasma cell signature and compare this to monoclonal gammopathy of undefined significance (MGUS) and myeloma (MM). 
Twenty-four samples from unselected newly diagnosed untreated AL patients were analysed. CD138+ cells were isolated from bone marrow cells using MACSorting (Miltenyi Biotech, Bisley, UK). Cells were lysed in RLT+ buffer and DNA/RNA extracted using the AllPrep kit (Qiagen, Manchester, UK). Peripheral blood was isolated from patients, white blood cells purified by Ficoll-Pacque and DNA extracted using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen). 
There were a median of 47 acquired nonsynonymous variants (range 4-253) per patient. Thirty percent of patients yielded a mutation in a myeloma driver gene. These mutations were either clonal or sub-clonal. There was evidence of MAPK activation with NRAS mutations, NF-κB activation and DNA repair pathway alterations. Exome data were used to determine the cytogenetic groups of AL samples and identified hyperdiploidy in 33% of cases and t(11;14) in 33% of cases. All translocations were generated via class switch recombination and breakpoints on chromosome 11 fell into the expected regions. A novel translocation, unlikely to be driving disease progression was identified involving RCC1. Finally, further analysis of the APCS gene encoding for the SAP protein did not show any biased genotype in the AL population in comparison to the general population. We conclude that exome sequencing identifies a genetic make-up of AL that is similar to other plasma cell disorders such as MM and MGUS. This not only includes copy number abnormalities and translocations but also nonsynonymous mutations."

Since founder populations are enriched with population-specific variants, we characterized the variants distribution in SLSJ and compared it with four European populations (Finnish, Sweden, United Kingdom and France), of which the Finnish population is another founder population.  Targeted sequencing of the coding and non-coding immune regulatory regions of the SLSJ asthma familial cohort and the four European populations were performed.  Rare and low-frequency coding and noncoding regulatory variants identified in the SLSJ population were then investigated for variant- and gene-level associations with asthma and allergy related-traits (eosinophil percentage, immunoglobulin (Ig)E levels and lung function). Our data showed that (1) rare or deleterious variants were not enriched in the two founder populations as compared to the three non-founder European populations; (2) a larger proportion of founder population-specific variants occurred with higher frequencies; and (3) low-frequency variants appeared to be more deleterious. Furthermore, a rare variant, rs1386931, located in the 3’UTR of CXCR6 and intron of FYCO1 was found to be associated with eosinophil percentage. Gene-based analyses identified NRP2, MRPL44 and SERPINE2 to be associated with various asthma and allergy related traits.

However,  little  is  known  about  the  effect  of  nCRT  in  the  mutational  landscape  and  intratumoral  genetic  heterogeneity  (ITGH)  of  rectal  tumors.  Moreover,  response  to  nCRT  vary  substantially  among  patients  and  the  genetic  determinants  of  treatment  response  are  not  fully  understood.  Here,  we  sought  to  determine  the  impact  of  nCRT  in  the  mutational  landscape  and  ITGH  of  rectal  tumors  and  to  identify  putative  drivers  of  therapeutic  resistance.  Patients  and  Methods:  We  analyzed  whole-exome  sequencing  (WES)  and  clinical  data  from  79  primary  non-treated  rectal  cancers  obtained  from  The  Cancer  Genome  Atlas  (TCGA).  We  also  compared  the  mutational  landscape  of  a  matched  set  of  peripheral  blood  cells,  irradiated  tumor-adjacent  colonic  mucosa  and  pre  and  post-treatment  tumor  samples  to  determine  the  iatrogenic  effects  of  nCRT  and  its  impact  in  tissue  genetic  heterogeneity.  Finally,  we  performed  WES  of  7  matched  pre  and  post-treatment  tumor  samples  to  examine  how  nCRT  affects  the  clonal  architecture  of  rectal  tumors.  Results:  We  show  that  rectal  tumors  exhibit  remarkable  ITGH,  which  increases  with  disease  progression.  We  also  show  that  nCRT,  per  se,  does  not  introduce  novel  somatic  mutations,  nor  alters  the  clonal  architecture  of  the  irradiated  colonic  mucosa.  Instead,  we  show  that  it  acts  as  a  potent  selective  pressure,  favoring  the  expansion  of  tumor  cell  subpopulations  more  prone  to  resist  therapy  and  increasing  ITGH  in  the  residual  tumor.  Conclusion:  Our  results  reveal  the  highly  heterogeneous  and  dynamic  clonal  architecture  of  rectal  tumors  undergoing  nCRT.  Our  results  also  uncover  putative  genetic  determinants  of  response  to  nCRT  and  a  possible  role  for  ITGH  in  predicting  treatment  outcome."

Fate conversion has been demonstrated by ectopic expression of master transcriptional regulators, such as PU.1 and C/EBP alpha that confers myeloid cell fate to other cell types, and PRDM16 that confers brown adipose fate to white adipocytes or myoblasts. Here we show that a transcriptional regulator overexpressed in human myeloid malignancies, PRDM16s, causes oncogenic fate conversion, by transforming cells fated to form platelets and erythrocytes into myeloid leukemia-initiating cells (LICs). Prdm16s expression in hematopoietic progenitor cells caused a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-like disease that progressed to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The myeloid diseases caused by Prdm16s exhibited expansion of megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs) but not granulocyte-macrophage progenitors. MEPs from Prdm16s-induced leukemia possessed LIC potential, and expression of Prdm16s in normal MEPs was sufficient to convert them to myeloid LICs and blocked megakaryocytic/erythroid potential. Prdm16s induced the expression of myeloid master regulators, including PU.1 and C/EBP alpha, by interacting with their super enhancers. Ablation of myeloid master regulators attenuated the myeloid potential and reinstalled the megakaryocytic/erythroid potential of leukemic-MEPs in mouse models and in human AML with PRDM16 rearrangement. Our study demonstrates that oncogenic Prdm16 expression converts the fate of MEPs to a malignant myeloid fate by activating myeloid master transcription factors."

EGAS00001003982,increased mutation accumulation  fetal development   syndrome,"Children with Down syndrome (DS) show a high incidence of leukemia, which is preceded by transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) in neonates. TMD is characterized by mutations in GATA1 that accumulate during fetal development, indicating that additional mutagenesis is required for leukemogenesis. Abnormalities in chromosome numbers can result in a mutator phenotype. However, it is unknown whether a trisomy of chromosome 21 (T21) results in enhanced mutation accumulation during human development. Here, we determined the mutational consequences of a constitutive T21 in DS fetuses compared to disomy 21 cells (D21) of D21 fetuses. We found that D21 fetal HPSCs had a higher somatic mutation rate compared to healthy adults HSPCs. Moreover, we observed an increase in somatic mutation load in T21 cells of DS fetuses, which was already apparent during the first cell divisions of embryogenesis. The mutation load could be explained by processes that are active during normal fetal development and were similar to those observed in TMD blast cells. Our study shows that T21 causes an increase in somatic load in fetal cells of DS fetuses, which may contribute to leukemia development early in life."
EGAS00001004459,khoe san genomes reveal unique variation  confirm deepest population divergence  homo sapiens,"The southern African indigenous Khoe-San populations harbor the most divergent lineages of all living peoples. Exploring their genomes is key to understanding deep human history. We sequenced 25 full genomes from five Khoe-San populations, revealing many novel variants, that 25% of variants are unique to the Khoe-San, and that the Khoe-San group harbors the greatest level of diversity across the globe. In line with previous studies, we found several gene-regions with extreme values in genome-wide distributions, potentially caused by natural selection early in the modern human lineage and more recent in time. These gene-regions included immunity-, sperm-, brain-, diet- and muscle-related genes. When accounting for recent admixture, all Khoe-San groups display genetic diversity approaching the levels in other African groups and a reduction in effective population size starting around 100,000 years ago. Hence, all human groups show a reduction in effective population size commencing around the time of the Out-of-Africa migrations, which coincides with changes in the paleoclimate records, changes that potentially impacted all humans at the time."

Characterizing pathogenesis is crucial for developing vaccines and therapeutics. However, the lack of models mirroring the cellular physiology and pathology of hAT2 cells limits the study. Here, we develop a feeder-free, long-term three-dimensional (3D) culture technique for hAT2 cells derived from primary human lung tissue, and investigate infection response to SARS-CoV-2. By imaging-based analysis and single-cell transcriptome profiling, we reveal rapid viral replication and the increased expression of interferon-associated genes and pro-inflammatory genes in infected hAT2 cells, indicating robust endogenous innate immune response. Further tracing of viral mutations acquired during transmission identifies full infection of individual cells effectively from a single viral entry. Our study provides deep insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and the application of defined 3D hAT2 cultures as models for respiratory diseases."
EGAS00001004600, universal gut metagenomic derived signature predicts cirrhosis,"Dysregulation of the gut microbiome has been implicated in the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. To determine the diagnostic capacity of this association, stool microbiomes were compared across 163 well-characterized participants encompassing non-NAFLD controls, NAFLD-cirrhosis patients and their first-degree relatives. Interrogation of shotgun metagenomic and untargeted metabolomic profiles using the Random Forest machine learning algorithm and differential abundance analysis identified discrete metagenomic and metabolomic signatures that were similarly effective in detecting cirrhosis (diagnostic accuracy 0.91, AUC). Combining the metagenomic signature with age and serum albumin levels accurately distinguished cirrhosis in etiologically and genetically distinct cohorts from geographically separated regions. Additional inclusion of serum aspartate aminotransferase levels, which are increased in cirrhosis patients, enabled discrimination of cirrhosis from earlier stages of fibrosis. These findings demonstrate that a core set of gut microbiome species may offer universal utility as a non-invasive diagnostic test for cirrhosis."

The dominant negative effect of PTEN alteration suggests that aberrant function of PTEN mutation might be more disastrous than deletion, the most frequent genomic event in glioblastoma (GBM). This study aimed to understand the functional properties of various PTEN missense mutations and to investigate their clinical relevance. The genomic landscape of PTEN alteration was analyzed using the Samsung Medical Center GBM cohort and validated via The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. Several hot-spot mutations were identified, and their subcellular distributions and phenotypes were evaluated. We established a library of cancer cell lines that over-express these mutant proteins using the U87MG and patient-derived cell models lacking functional PTEN. PTEN mutations were categorized into two major subsets: missense mutations in the phosphatase domain and truncal mutations in the C2 domain. We determined the subcellular compartmentalization of four mutant proteins (H93Y, C124S, R130Q, and R173C) from the former group and found that they had distinct localizations; those associated with invasive phenotypes (‘edge mutations’) localized to the cell periphery, while the R173C mutant localized to the nucleus. Invasive phenotypes derived from edge substitutions were unaffected by an anti-PI3K/Akt agent but were disrupted by microtubule inhibitors. PTEN mutations exhibit distinct functional properties with regard to their subcellular localization. Further, some missense mutations (‘edge mutations’) in the phosphatase domain caused enhanced invasiveness associated with dysfunctional cytoskeletal assembly, thus suggesting it to be a potent therapeutic target."

The estimated incidence and prevalence for CMD is 4.65/100,000 and 0.68/100,000 respectively, although these are probably an underestimate. Patients present at birth or within the first few months of life with hypotonia and muscle weakness. Other features include eye and brain abnormalities, joint contractures, respiratory and cardiac involvement and skin changes. The majority are severely progressive and there is no treatment available. There are 24 known causative genes (LAMA2, COL6A1, COL6A2, COL6A3, COL12A1, ITGA7, ITGA9, SEPN1, LMNA, CHKB, POMT1, POMT2, POMGNT1, FKTN, FKRP, LARGE, DPM3, DPM2, DAG1, DOLK, ISPD, B3GNT1, B3GALNT2, GMPPB) . Except for collagen genes and LMNA, in most cases mutations are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Several of these genes have been identified very recently by Whole-Exome-Sequencing (for example COL12A1, B3GALNT2 and GMPPB) demonstrating the suitability of this technique in the field of muscular dystrophies. However, there are patients in whom all known genetic forms have been excluded which are clinically and pathologically undistinguishable from genetically defined forms. A recent study of the UK population indicates that collagen VI defects are the most common subgroup (which is also our experience in the Spanish population).  However, in that same study a genetic diagnosis could not be reached in 50% of CMD cases after testing of all genes. Diagnosis is based on clinical assessment and analysis of muscle biopsy or fibroblast cultures using antibodies that recognise the primary or secondary defective proteins such as collagen VI, α-dystroglycan and laminin-α2, although these are not always conclusive and there is overlap between different forms (for example in the dystroglycanopathies). Brain and muscle magnetic resonance imaging can also help towards diagnosis. A combination of these techniques is used to guide gene sequencing which is often done one a gene by gene basis or sometimes using panels for a selection of genes. Prenatal diagnosis can be performed in some cases."

EGAS00001003814, precision medicine  liver cancer   asia pacific network planet intratumoural immune heterogeneity,"The clinical relevance of immune landscape intratumoural heterogeneity (immune-ITH) and its role in tumour evolution remain largely unexplored. Here, we uncover significant spatial and phenotypic immune–ITH from multiple tumour sectors and decipher its relationship with tumour evolution and disease progression in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). Immune–ITH is associated with tumour transcriptomic-ITH, mutational burden, and distinct immune microenvironments. Tumours with low immune–ITH experience higher immunoselective pressure and escape via loss of heterozygosity in human leukocyte antigens and immunoediting. Instead, the tumours with high immune-ITH evolve to a more immunosuppressive/exhausted microenvironment. This gradient of immune pressure along with immune-ITH represents a hallmark of tumour evolution, which is closely linked to the transcriptome-immune networks that contributes to disease progression and immune inactivation. Remarkably, high immune-ITH and its transcriptomic signature are predictive for worse clinical outcome in HCC patients. This in-depth investigation of ITH provides evidence on tumour-immune co-evolution along HCC progression."

Analysis of whole transcriptome data showed that T cell infiltration and interferon-gamma signaling signatures corresponded most highly with clinical response to therapy, with a reciprocal decrease in cell cycle and WNT signaling pathways in responding biopsies. Clinical outcome differences were likely not due to differential melanoma cell responses to interferon-gamma, as 57 human melanoma cell lines exposed in vitro to this cytokine showed a conserved interferon-gamma transcriptome response unless they had mutations that precluded signaling from the interferon-gamma receptor. Therefore, the magnitude of the antitumor T cell response and the corresponding downstream interferon-gamma signaling are the main drivers of clinical response or resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy."

We assessed expression of markers associated with PC longevity in 15 untreated and 26 treated CeD patients in addition to 13 non-CeD controls, and performed RNA-sequencing with clonal inference and transcriptomic analysis of 3251 single PCs. We observed antigen-dependent V-gene selection and stereotypic antibodies. Generation of recombinant DGP-specific antibodies revealed a key role of a heavy-chain residue that displays polymorphism, suggesting that immunoglobulin gene polymorphisms may influence CeD-specific antibody responses. We identified transcriptional differences between CeD-specific vs non-disease-specific PCs and between short-lived vs long-lived PCs. The short-lived CD19+CD45+ phenotype dominated in untreated and short-term-treated CeD, in particular among disease-specific PCs but also in the general PC population. Thus, the disease lesion of untreated CeD is characterized by massive accumulation of short-lived PCs that are not only directed against disease-specific antigens."

Pre-analytical and analytical variations and degradation may introduce bias in representation of DNA and miRNA and may result in loss or corruption of quantitative data.  Methods: We have evaluated DNA and miRNA quantity, quality and variability in samples stored up to 40 years using one of the oldest serum collections, the Janus Serumbank, a biorepository dedicated to cancer research.  Results: miRNAs are present and stable in archived serum samples frozen at ‒25°C for at least 40 years. Longtime-storage did not reduce miRNA yields, however, varying pre-analytical conditions had a significant effect and should be taken into consideration during project design. 500µl serum yielded sufficient miRNA for qPCR and small RNA sequencing and on average 650 unique miRNAs were detected in samples from presumably healthy donors. 500µl serum yielded sufficient DNA for whole-genome sequencing and subsequent SNP calling, giving a uniform representation of the genomes.  Conclusions: DNA and miRNA are stable during long-term storage, making large prospectively collected serum repositories an invaluable source for miRNA and DNA biomarker discovery. Impact: Large-scale cancer biomarker studies with long follow-up times are possible utilizing biorepositories with archived serum and state-of-the-art technology."
EGAS00001004760,robust detection  translocations  lymphoma ffpe samples  targeted locus capture based sequencing,"Chromosomal translocations with immunoglobin (IG) loci are the classic drivers in a large subset of B-cell lymphomas. Detection of these translocations is important for confirmation of diagnosis and for prognosis and therapy decisions. Currently, molecular diagnosis of translocations in lymphomas is not addressed well by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). The standard method for detection of translocations is Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH), which is labor-intensive, and can be difficult to interpret. There is a need for a robust technology that can be standardized. Targeted Locus Capture (TLC) selectively enriches and sequences entire genes based on the crosslinking of physically proximal sequences, and thereby enables complete sequencing of genes of interest, including detection of large structural variants. Because the technology is based on the crosslinking and fragmenting of DNA, it has particular advantages in the analysis of Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) samples, in which DNA is inherently crosslinked and fragmented. In order to validate the FFPE-TLC technology as a novel approach for translocation detection in lymphoma samples, we have developed a panel assay containing genes with frequent translocations (MYC, BCL2, BCL6, IG loci). With this assay we have analyzed &gt;140 lymphoma and control FFPE samples of variable input amounts and qualities that had previously been analyzed with FISH, and a subset also with standard targeted NGS. Good concordance with FISH results was observed for both translocation positive and negative samples. In 10 cases for which FFPE-TLC detected a relevant fusion and FISH had been called negative, discordance could be explained by higher sensitivity of FFPE-TLC or by inconclusive FISH results. In a specific case, FFPE-TLC detected a small-distance rearrangement on chromosome 3 that caused a BCL6 fusion but led to insufficient and therefore undetectable break-apart with FISH. Secondly, the FFPE-TLC approach was tested on a set of 19 B-cell lymphoma FFPE samples that had previously been analyzed using standard targeted NGS and FISH and was enriched for discordant results between these methods. FFPE-TLC-based NGS enables more robust translocation calling as the detection relies on broad sequencing coverage across the translocation partner rather than on breakpoint sequences only. In 3 cases, FFPE-TLC could proof false negative calls in standard targeted NGS due to breakpoints located in regions difficult to capture or to sequence. In 1 case, standard targeted NGS had made a false positive call on a breakpoint sequence that was shown to be caused by a small insertion rather than a genuine translocation. This study shows that FFPE-TLC promises to be a robust alternative for FISH analysis and standard targeted NGS procedures in lymphoma diagnostics and possibly in other cancers with frequent structural variants. The FFPE-TLC approach enables a single, DNA-based NGS test detecting both small mutations and translocations."

Chemotherapy induces remission in the majority of patients, but relapse rates are high and lead to poor clinical outcomes. Since this is primarily caused by chemotherapy-resistant leukemic stem cells (LSCs), it is essential to eradicate LSCs to improve patient survival. LSCs have predominantly been studied at the transcript level, thus lacking information about post-transcriptionally regulated genes and associated networks. Here we extend our previous report on LSC proteomes to healthy age-matched hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and correlate the proteomes to the corresponding transcriptomes. By comparing LSCs to leukemic blasts and healthy HSPCs, we validate candidate LSC markers and highlight novel and potentially targetable proteins that are absent or only lowly expressed in HSPCs. In addition, our data provides strong evidence that LSCs harbor a characteristic energy metabolism, adhesion molecule composition, as well as RNA processing properties. Furthermore, correlating proteome and transcript data of the same individual samples highlights the strength of proteome analyses, which are particularly potent in detecting alterations in metabolic pathways. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive proteomic and transcriptomic characterization of functionally validated LSCs, blasts and healthy HSPCs, representing a valuable resource helping to design LSC-directed therapies."

Here, we integrate in situ Hi-C and nine additional omic layers to define and biologically characterize the dynamic changes in three-dimensional (3D) genome architecture across normal B cell differentiation and in neoplastic cells from different subtypes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients. Beyond conventional active (A) and inactive (B) compartments, an integrative analysis of Hi-C data uncovers a highly-dynamic intermediate compartment enriched in poised and polycomb-repressed chromatin. During B cell development, we detect that 28% of the compartments change at defined maturation stages and mostly involve the intermediate compartment. The transition from naive to germinal center B cells is associated with widespread chromatin activation, which mostly reverts into the naive state upon further maturation of germinal center cells into memory B cells. The analysis of CLL and MCL neoplastic cells points both to entity and subtype-specific alterations in chromosome organization. Remarkably, we observe that large chromatin blocks containing key disease-specific genes alter their 3D genome organization. These include the inactivation of a 2Mb region containing the EBF1 gene in CLL and the activation of a 6.1Mb region containing the SOX11 gene in clinically aggressive MCL. This study indicates that 3D genome interactions are extensively modulated during normal B cell differentiation and that the genome of B cell neoplasias acquires a tumor-specific 3D genome architecture."

Here we pursued integrative whole-genome, transcriptome and methylome-based analysis of early-onset prostate cancer patients. Characterisation of genomic alterations across 270 PCa tumours revealed age-related genomic alterations and mutation signatures including BRCAness and APOBEC. We used methylation- and expression-data to identify four molecular subgroups, which included a highly aggressive tumour subgroup that frequently involved recurrent duplications and increased expression of ESRP1. Analysis of 12,000 tissue-microarray tumour samples demonstrated that ESRP1 is a candidate biomarker associated with faster proliferation rate and shorter time to relapse. We combine the patterns of molecular co-occurrence, risk-stratification and subgroup information to deconvolute tumor heterogeneity, which reveal complex but recurrent clinical trajectories of prostate cancer."

The machine learning classification models trained using the signature genes performed significantly better in predicting metastases than models trained with clinical covariates (pAUROC=0.02), or published prognostic signatures. The signature score negatively correlated with measures of immune cell infiltration (ρ=-0.75, p&lt;2.2x10-16), with a higher score representing reduced lymphocyte infiltration and a higher 5-year risk of death in stage II melanoma.

As a result of their cell- and cancer-specific expression patterns, lncRNAs have emerged as potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets. The accurate characterization of lncRNAs in bulk transcriptome data remains challenging due to their low abundance compared to protein coding genes. To tackle this issue, we describe a unique short-read custom lncRNA capture sequencing approach that relies on a comprehensive set of 565,878 capture probes for 49,372 human lncRNA genes. This custom lncRNA capture approach was evaluated on various sample types ranging from artificial high-quality RNA mixtures to more challenging formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue and biofluid material. The custom enrichment approach allows the detection of a more diverse repertoire of lncRNAs, with better reproducibility and higher coverage compared to classic total RNA-sequencing."
EGAS00001004661,scrna seq  patient derived pdac organoids,"We derived PDAC organoids from primary tumors of 18 patients, together with two matched samples from liver metastases. By single-cell RNA sequencing, we show that PDAC organoids consist of ductal cells with patient-specific expression of several gene groups, including genes which encode cell surface proteins. We report ‘classical’ and ‘basal-like’ cells coexisting within single primary tumors or metastases, with greater intratumor subtype heterogeneity linked to higher tumor grade. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of PDAC organoids and primary PDAC identified distinct tumor cell states shared across patients, including a cycling progenitor cell state and a differentiated secretory state. We show that these cell states are connected by a differentiation hierarchy, with ‘classical’ subtype cells concentrated at the endpoint of this hierarchy."

EGAS00001004772,hypertension delays viral clearance  exacerbates airway hyperinflammation  patients  covid 19,"In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), hypertension and cardiovascular diseases are major risk factors for critical disease progression. However, the underlying causes and the effects of the main anti-hypertensive therapies-angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)-remain unclear. Combining clinical data (n = 144) and single-cell sequencing data of airway samples (n = 48) with in vitro experiments, we observed a distinct inflammatory predisposition of immune cells in patients with hypertension that correlated with critical COVID-19 progression. ACEI treatment was associated with dampened COVID-19-related hyperinflammation and with increased cell intrinsic antiviral responses, whereas ARB treatment related to enhanced epithelial-immune cell interactions. Macrophages and neutrophils of patients with hypertension, in particular under ARB treatment, exhibited higher expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines CCL3 and CCL4 and the chemokine receptor CCR1. Although the limited size of our cohort does not allow us to establish clinical efficacy, our data suggest that the clinical benefits of ACEI treatment in patients with COVID-19 who have hypertension warrant further investigation."

EGAS00001003000,biallelic tumor suppressor loss  dna repair defects  de novo small cell prostate cancer,"Small cell prostatic carcinoma (SCPC) is an aggressive pathology that is managed similar to small cell lung cancer. SCPC can evolve from prostatic adenocarcinoma in response to androgen deprivation therapy but in rare cases is present at initial cancer diagnosis. The molecular etiology of de novo SCPC is incompletely understood due to the scarcity of tumor tissue and the brief life expectancy of patients. Through a retrospective search of our regional oncology pharmacy database, we identified 18 patients diagnosed with de novo SCPC between 2004 and 2017. Ten patients had pure SCPC pathology and the remainder had some admixed adenocarcinoma foci, but all were treated with first line platinum-based chemotherapy. Median overall survival was 28 months. We performed targeted DNA sequencing, whole exome sequencing and mRNA profiling on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded archival tumor tissue. We observed frequent biallelic deletion and/or mutation of tumor suppressors TP53, RB1 and PTEN, similar to treatment-related SCPC. Indeed, at the RNA level pure de novo SCPC closely resembled treatment-related SCPC. However, five patients had biallelic loss of DNA repair genes including BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM and MSH2/6: potentially underlying the high genomic instability of this rare disease variant. Two patients with pure de novo SCPC harbored ETS gene rearrangements to androgen-driven promoters, consistent with evolution of de novo SCPC from an androgen-driven ancestor. Overall, our results reveal a highly aggressive molecular landscape underlies this unusual pathologic variant, and propose opportunities for targeted therapy strategies in a disease with few treatment options."

To better understand neuroblastoma pathogenesis, here we analyze whole-genome, whole-exome and/or transcriptome sequencing data from 702 neuroblastoma samples, half of which are new data. Over 95% of samples harbor at least one recurrent driver alteration and most aberrations, including MYCN, ATRX, and TERT alterations, differ in frequency by age. MYCN alterations occur at median 2.3 years of age, TERT at 3.8 years, and ATRX at 5.6 years, suggesting age-specific susceptibility to genetic alterations. Mutational signature analysis shows that reactive oxygen-species (ROS)-induced mutations are the most common cause of single nucleotide variant (SNV) drivers in neuroblastoma, including most ALK and Ras pathway SNVs.  ROS-induced mutagenesis is both an early event, as it causes truncal variants, and continuous as it also induces relapse-specific mutations. ROS-induced mutations are more abundant in neuroblastomas with MYCN amplification, 17q gains, and increased expression of mitochondrial ribosome genes. We observe recurrent FGFR1 N546K or internal tandem duplication variants in 6 patients and ALK N-terminal structural alterations in 5 samples, identifying additional patients amenable to precision therapy."

We hypothesize that genomic analysis between pre-invasive and invasive components will facilitate the description of LUAD evolutionary patterns. We micro-dissect malignant pulmonary nodules (MPNs) into paired pre-invasive and invasive components for panel-genomic sequencing and recognize three evolutionary trajectories. Evolutionary mode 1 (EM1) demonstrates none of the common driver events between paired components, but another two modes, EM2A and EM2B, exhibit critical private alterations restricted to pre-invasive and invasive components, respectively. When ancestral clones harbor EGFR mutations, truncal mutation abundance significantly decrease after the acquisition of invasiveness, which may be associated with the intratumoral accumulation of infiltrated B cells. Harboring EGFR mutations is critical to the selective pressure and further impacts the prognosis. Our findings extend the understanding of evolutionary trajectories during invasiveness acquisition in early LUAD."

Currently, LMS treatment is not informed by molecular subtyping and is associated with highly variable survival. While disease site continues to dictate clinical management, the contribution of genetic factors to LMS subtype, origins, and timing are unknown. Here we analyzed 70 genomes and 130 transcriptomes of LMS, including multiple tumor regions and paired metastases. Molecular profiling highlighted the extremely early origins of LMS. Three specific subtypes of LMS develop from distinct lineages of smooth muscle cells. Of these, dedifferentiated LMS with high immune infiltration and tumors primarily of gynaecological origin acquired the highest burden of genomic mutation and are associated with worse survival. Homologous recombination defects lead to genome-wide mutational signatures, and a corresponding sensitivity to PARP and other DNA damage response inhibitors, suggesting a novel  therapeutic    strategy for LMS. Finally, by phylogenetic reconstruction, we present evidence that clones seeding lethal metastases arise decades prior to LMS diagnosis."

Whether this is a direct effect or a consequence of global immune changes with effects on NK cell homeostasis remains unknown. Here, we used high-resolution flow- and mass cytometry to examine NK cell repertoires in 64 patients with neutropenia and 27 healthy age- and gender-matched donors. A subgroup of patients with chronic neutropenia showed severely disrupted NK cell homeostasis manifested as increased frequencies of CD56bright NK cells and a lack of mature CD56dim NK cells. These immature NK cell repertoires were characterized by expression of proliferation/exhaustion markers Ki-67, Tim-3 and TIGIT and displayed blunted tumor target cell responses. Systems-level immune mapping revealed that the changes in immunophenotypes were confined to NK cells, leaving T cell differentiation intact. RNA sequencing of NK cells from these patients showed upregulation of a network of genes, including TNFSF9, CENPF, MKI67 and TOP2A, associated with apoptosis and the cell cycle, different from conventional CD56bright signatures. Profiling of 249 plasma proteins showed a coordinated enrichment of pathways related to apoptosis and cell turnover, which correlated with immature NK cell repertoires. Notably, most of these patients exhibited severe-grade neutropenia, suggesting that the profoundly altered NK cell homeostasis was connected to the severity of their underlying etiology. Hence, although our data suggests that neutrophils are dispensable for NK cell development and differentiation, some patients displayed a specific gap in the NK repertoire, associated with poor cytotoxic function and more severe disease manifestations."

Experimental Design: One-hundred patients were diagnosed with DLBCL during the study period. Mutational status of 112 genes was studied in cfDNA by targeted next-generation sequencing. Paired formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples and volumetric PET/CT were assessed when available. 
Results: Appropriate cfDNA to perform the analyses was obtained in 79/100 cases. At least one mutation could be detected in 69/79 cases (87%). The sensitivity of cfDNA to detect the mutations was 68% (95% CI: 56.2-78.7). The mutational landscape found in cfDNA samples was highly consistent with that shown in the tissue and allowed genetic classification in 43% of the cases. A higher amount of ctDNA significantly correlated with clinical parameters related to tumor burden (elevated LDH and β2-microglobulin serum levels, advanced stage, and high-risk IPI) and total metabolic tumor volume assessed by PET/CT. In patients treated with curative intent, high ctDNA levels (&amp;gt;2.5 log hGE/mL) were associated with lower complete response (65% vs. 96%, P&amp;lt;0.004), shorter progression-free survival (65% vs. 85%, P=0.038) and overall survival (73% vs. 100%, P=0.007) at 2 years, although it did not maintain prognostic value in multivariate analyses. 
Conclusions: In a population-based prospective DLBCL series, cfDNA resulted an alternative source to estimate tumor burden and to determine the tumor mutational profile and genetic classification, which have prognostic implications and may contribute to a future tailored"

One MYC super-enhancer element in particular, which recruits early hematopoietic regulators, is critical for EVI1 expression and enhancer-promoter interaction. This interaction is facilitated by a CTCF-bound motif upstream of the EVI1 promoter that acts as an enhancer-docking site in t(3;8) AML.

To better understand the genetic alterations underlying the pathogenesis of these tumors, we performed comprehensive genome analyses of 25 fresh-frozen tumors, including whole genome sequencing, expression and pathway analyses. In addition to the well-described MYB-NFIB fusion which was found in 11 tumors (44%), we observed five different rearrangements involving the NFIB transcription factor gene in seven tumors (28%). Taken together, NFIB translocations occurred in 15 of 25 samples (60%, 95%CI=41–77%). In addition, mRNA expression analysis of 17 tumors revealed overexpression of NFIB in ACC tumors compared with normal tissues (p=0.002). There was no difference in NFIB mRNA expression in tumors with NFIB fusions compared to those without. We also report somatic mutations of genes involved in the axonal guidance and Rho family signaling pathways. Finally, we confirm previously described alterations in genes related to chromatin regulation and Notch signaling. Our findings suggest a separate role for NFIB in ACC oncogenesis and highlight important signaling pathways for future functional characterization and potential therapeutic targeting."
EGAS00001004739,prognostic  therapeutic significance  leukemia subtypes  minimal residual disease measurements  pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated  contemporary risk directed trial  cohort study,"Background Genomic analyses to identify leukemia subtypes and refinement of minimal residual disease (MRD) determination are two recent advances that would have substantial impact on the management of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, the combined application of these two approaches to determine the prognostic and therapeutic significance of MRD measurement and full spectrum of leukemia subtypes in the context of contemporary risk-directed therapy has not been studied comprehensively.MethodsBetween October 29, 2007 and March 26, 2017, 598 consecutive children with newly diagnosed ALL were enrolled in a clinical trial at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Patients were provisional classified according to the presenting clinical and laboratory features including immunophenotype and cytogenetics. Patients with ETV6-RUNX1 and high hyperdiploid B-progenitor ALL were provisionally included in the low-risk groups; those with TCF3-PBX1, hypodiploidy and T-cell ALL in the standard (intermediate)-risk group; and patients with BCR-ABL1, KMT2A and early T-cell precursor ALL in the high-risk group. Final risk assignment was based primarily on MRD levels measured by flow cytometry on Day 15 (≥1%) and Day 42 (&lt;0.01% or ≥1%) of remission induction. Using genomic classification based on cytogenetics and genomic analysis (single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis and transcriptome, exome, and genome sequencing), patients were classified into 17 subtypes. The primary aim was to determine the event-free survival, overall survival and cumulative risk of relapse according to specific leukemia subtypes and MRD levels on Days 8, 15 and 42 of remission induction. This clinical trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00549848.FindingsPatients with ETV6-RUNX1, high hyperdiploidy and DUX4-rearranged B-ALL all received low- or standard-risk therapy, and had the highest 5-year event-free survival rates: 98.4% (95% CI, 95.9-100), 95.3% (91.2-99.4), and 95.0% (84.2-100), respectively. All 142 patients with Day 8 MRD&lt;0.01%, except two with KMT2A-rearranged ALL and one with TCF3-PBX1, were in continuous complete remission. The TCF3-PBX1, PAX5alt, T-cell, early T-cell precursor, iAMP21 and hypodiploid ALL had intermediate outcome with 5-year event-free survival rates ranging from 80.0% (39.4-100) to 88.2% (71.7-100). Patients with KMT2A-rearranged, BCR-ABL1, BCR-ABL1-like and ETV6-RUNX1-like ALL had the worst outcomes, with 5-year event-free survival rates between 64.1% (43.9-84.3) and 76.2% (51.9-100), despite most patients receiving standard- or high-risk therapy. Treatment intensification based on MRD and genotype improved outcome. Relapse did not occur in any of the patients with ETV6-RUNX1, DUX4-rearranged, TCF3-PBX1, iAMP21, ZNF384-rearranged, hypodiploid, or BCR-ABL1-like B-ALL who had day 15 MRD≥1% and received standard-risk therapy.  However, day 42 MRD&lt;0.01% did not preclude relapse in patients with intermediate-risk or unfavorable subtypes including TCF3-PBX1, PAX5alt, T-cell, iAMP21, BCR-ABL1, BCR-ABL1-like, ETV6-RUNX1-like, KMT2A-rearranged, and MEF2D-rearranged ALL, despite intensified treatment in the standard- or high-risk arms. InterpretationContemporary risk-directed treatment based on genotypes and MRD can cure virtually all patients with ETV6-RUNX1, hyperdiploid&gt;50 and DUX4-rearranged ALL. While intensified treatment improve outcome for patients with high MRD during induction, substantial proportions of patients with intermediate-risk or unfavorable subtypes would still relapse even achieving negative MRD status at the end of induction and require novel therapeutics to improve outcome."

EGAS00001004814,transcriptional profiling  ovarian tumours  cell lines,"Purpose: Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) play a role in a variety of biological processes, including embryogenesis and cancer. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi)-induced ERV expression triggers interferon responses in ovarian cancer cells via the viral sensing machinery. Baseline expression of ERVs also occurs in cancer cells, though this process is poorly understood and previously unexplored in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).
Here, the prognostic and immunomodulatory consequences of baseline ERV expression was assessed in EOC.
Experimental Design: ERV expression was assessed using EOC transcriptional data from TCGA and from an independent cohort (HH), as well as from untreated or DNMTi-treated EOC cell lines. LASSO logistic regression defined an ERV expression score to predict patient prognosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was conducted on the HH cohort. Combination of DNMTi treatment with γδ T cells was tested in vitro, using EOC cell lines and patient-derived tumor cells.
Results: ERV expression was found to define clinically relevant subsets of EOC patients. An ERV prognostic score was successfully generated in TCGA and validated in the independent cohort. In EOC patients from this cohort, a high ERV score was associated with better survival (log-rank p=0.0009) and correlated with infiltration of CD8+PD1+ T cells (r=0.46, p=0.0001).
In vitro, baseline ERV expression dictates the level of ERV induction in response to DNMTi. Manipulation of ERV expression by DNMTi resulted in improved EOC cell killing by cytotoxic immune cells.
Conclusions: These findings uncover the potential for baseline ERV expression to robustly inform EOC patient prognosis, influence tumor immune infiltration and affect anti-tumor immunity."
EGAS00001004809,biokey  single cell catalogue   dynamic changes underlying checkpoint immunotherapy response  early breast cancer,"Checkpoint immunotherapy combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves complete pathologic response in a subset of breast cancer patients. Here, we applied single-cell profiling to tumor biopsies collected before and during anti-PD1 therapy. One-third of tumors exhibited proliferative T-cells expanding along CD8+ or CD4+ lineages, which were either characterized by increased cytotoxicity and exhaustion or improved T-helper function, respectively. Lineage tracing in non-expanding tumors revealed at which point in the lineage T-cells were impaired, while gene expression modeling along these lineages revealed novel genes and underlying transcription factors involved in T-cell expansion. Interestingly, different dendritic and myeloid cell phenotypes could either stimulate or inhibit expanding T-cells, while cell-to-cell communication revealed an integrated immune context highly predictive of T-cell expansion, consisting of immune-stimulatory/-inhibitory interactions between cancer and various immune cell types. Our data yield unprecedented insights into the dynamic changes underlying checkpoint immunotherapy response in breast cancer."

Colorectal cancer presents a difficult treatment paradigm, with over 40% of patients presenting at diagnosis with metastatic disease. We hypothesised that cWGS coupled with 3’ transcriptome analysis would give new insights into colorectal cancer.Methods: Patients underwent PCR-free whole genome sequencing and alignment and variant calling using a standardised pipeline to output SNVs, indels, SVs and CNAs. Additional insights into mutational signatures and tumour biology were gained by the use of 3’ RNAseq.Results: Fifty-four patients were studied in total. Driver analysis identified the Wnt pathway gene APC as the only consistently mutated driver in colorectal cancer. Alterations in the PI3K/mTOR pathways were seen as previously observed in CRC. Multiple private CNAs, SVs and gene fusions were unique to individual tumours. Approximately 30% of patients had a tumour mutational burden of &gt;10 mutations/Mb of DNA, suggesting suitability for immunotherapy. Conclusions: Clinical whole genome sequencing offers a potential avenue for identification of private genomic variation that may confer sensitivity to targeted agents and offer patients new options for targeted therapies."

As the resident white blood cells, they are the main active immune defence in the central nervous system (CNS). Microglia are part of an important class of cells known as macrophages that have two main states: M1 and M2. M1 cells are pro- inflammatory, leading to more inflammation, while M2 are anti-inflammatory, and drive wound healing. In this study, we will collect primary microglia from surgical biospies of 100  individuals.

Methods
The BARIA Study aims to assess how microbiota and their metabolites affect transcription in key tissues and clinical outcome in obese subjects and how baseline anthropometric and metabolic characteristics determine weight loss and glucose homeostasis after bariatric surgery. We phenotype patients undergoing bariatric surgery (predominantly laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass), before weight loss, with biometrics, dietary and psychological questionnaires, mixed meal test (MMT) and collect fecal-samples and intra-operative biopsies from liver, adipose tissues and jejunum. We aim to include 1500 patients. A subset (approximately 25%) will undergo intra-operative portal vein blood-sampling. Fecal-samples are analyzed with shotgun metagenomics and targeted metabolomics, fasted and postprandial plasma-samples are subjected to metabolomics, and RNA is extracted from the tissues for RNAseq-analyses.

We investigated the role of MRD in refining complete remission (CR) and treatment duration in the phase III PETHEMA-FLUGAZA clinical trial, that randomized 283 elderly AML patients to induction and consolidation with fludarabine plus cytarabine or induction and consolidation with 5-azacitidine. After consolidation, patients continued treatment if MRD≥0.01% or stopped if MRD&lt;0.01%, assessed by multidimensional flow cytometry (MFC). On multivariate analysis including genetic risk and treatment arm, MRD status in patients achieving CR (N=72) was the only independent prognostic factor for cumulative-incidence of relapse (HR:2.95;P=.002) and relapse-free survival (HR:3.45;P=.002). A trend for longer overall survival was observed in patients with undetectable MRD (N=13/72). Although leukemic cells from most elderly AML patients display phenotypic aberrancies vs their normal counterpart (N=258/265), CD34 progenitors from cases with undetectable MRD by MFC displayed extensive genetic abnormalities identified by whole-exome sequencing. This study supports MRD assessment to refine CR after semi-intensive therapy or hypomethylating agents, but unveils that improved sensitivity is warranted to individualize treatment and prolong survival of elderly AML patients achieving undetectable MRD."

Using standard single marker- and haplotype-based approaches, we report evidence of two regions with distinctive patterns of genetic variation, one in the far northeast, and another in the south of Norway, as indicated by fixation indices, haplotype sharing, homozygosity and effective population size. We detect and quantify a component of Uralic Sami ancestry that is enriched in the North. On a finer scale, we find that rates of migration have been affected by topography like mountain ridges. In the broader Scandinavian context, we detect elevated relatedness between the mid- and northern border areas towards Sweden. The main finding of this study is that despite Norway’s long maritime history and as a former Danish territory, the region closest to mainland Europe in the south appears to have been the most isolated region in Norway, highlighting the open sea as a barrier to gene flow into Norway."

EGAS00001005668,perturbing t cell activation circuitries  single cell resolution,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of genetic variants associated with complex immune-mediated diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis. These genetic links provide critical clues to processes underlying disease biology and increase the chances of development of successful therapeutic targets. However, the mechanisms by which GWAS variants increase disease susceptibility are difficult to unravel since most of them lie in non-coding areas of the genome 1. Thus, we first need to identify: 1) in which cell types (and specific cellular states) these genetic variants are relevant, 2) what are the causal genes affecting disease susceptibility and 3) what are the function of these genes in different cell states. Several studies have placed CD4+ T cells as central effectors during immune dysregulation in disease pathology. Our work within the Open Targets Consortium demonstrated that immune disease variants point towards genetic dysregulation of CD4+ memory T cells. Memory T cells possess many differences from naïve T cells that contribute to their efficiency to promptly promote secondary immune responses. We showed that rather than falling into distinct populations, naive and memory cells form a transcriptional continuum of cell states from naïve through central to effector memory T cells. This effectorness gradient influences the response of T cells to the environment. This implies that these differences may also affect how disease-genes modulate naïve and memory cell activation and therefore needs to be studied through single cell approaches. To unveil new links between disease risk variants, genes and activation states, we mapped single-cell eQTLs in memory and naive T cells at resting state or 16, 40 and 120 hours after activation. We identified over 3000 eQTL signals in this dataset at different time points. By combining these data with existing GWAS signals we are identifying hundreds of genes for which sc-eQTL and GWAS variants colocalise, therefore implicating shared causal mechanisms between the gene expression and disease-traits. Here, we propose to build on these data by using CRISPR screens in combination with single cell RNA-sequencing to evaluate the effects of disease candidate genes (identified in our colocalisation studies) on T cell activation."

Eighteen of the 23 relapse tumors (78%) showed RAS-MAPK pathway mutations. Seven events were detected only in the relapse tumor while the others showed clonal enrichment. In neuroblastoma cell lines we also detected a high frequency of activating mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway (11/18, 61%) and these lesions predicted for sensitivity to MEK inhibition in vitro and in vivo.

Initially, the 48-year old female diagnosed with high-risk APL had achieved complete molecular remission after standard treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy according to the AIDA protocol. 13 months after start of ATRA maintenance the patient suffered clinically overt meningeal relapse along with minute molecular traces of PML/RARA in the bone marrow. Following treatment with arsenic trioxide (ATO) and ATRA in combination with intrathecal cytarabine and methotrexate, the patient achieved a complete molecular remission in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and bone marrow, which currently lasts for two years after completion of therapy. Whole exome sequencing and subsequent ultradeep targeted re-sequencing revealed a heterozygous FLT3-TKD mutation in CSF leukemic cells (p.D835Y, c.2503G&gt;T, 1000/1961 reads (51%)), which was undetectable in the concurrent bone marrow sample. Interestingly, the FLT3-TKD mutated meningeal clone originated from a small bone marrow subclone present in a variant allele frequency of 0.4% (6/1553 reads) at initial diagnosis. This case highlights the concept of clonal evolution with a subclone harboring an additional mutation being selected as the “fittest” and leading to meningeal relapse. It also further supports earlier suggestions that FLT3 mutations may play a role for migration and clonal expansion in the CSF sanctuary site.H021"

Although genetic susceptibility is important, a modest concordance rate for MS in monozygotic (MZ) twins suggests that interaction with other risk factors is required to develop clinical symptoms. In this study, we examined whether DNA methylation differences contribute to the discordant clinical manifestation of MS in MZ twins, and studied the impact of MS treatments on the DNA methylome. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 45 MZ twins clinically discordant for MS were generated using the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array. Repetitive element methylation and selected differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were validated using targeted deep bisulfite sequencing (TDBS). In addition, we performed whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to profile CD4+ memory T-cells of a subset of four MS discordant MZ twins. Our results show that interferon treatment causes robust DNA methylation changes and several epigenetic biomarkers for interferon treatment response were identified. However, overall the PBMC-based methylomes of the MS discordant MZ twins were highly similar, since large systematic methylation differences (&gt;5%) were absent in the data. This suggests that previously reported large methylation changes are probably caused by genetic rather than epigenetic differences. In addition, our data does not support the hypothesis that the observed maternal parent-of-origin effect in MS is due to genomic imprinting errors, and no evidence was found that copy number variations explain the discordant phenotype in these MZ twins. Although not genome-wide significant, a couple of DMPs associated with the MS phenotype were identified and successfully technically replicated using TDBS, including a differentially methylated region (DMR) in the promoter of the transmembrane protein encoding gene TMEM232. Another MS-associated DMP, located in an enhancer in the gene body of the transcription factor ZBTB16, was also associated with medium-term glucocorticoid treatment history. WGBS analysis confirmed this DMP as an epigenetic biomarker for glucocorticoid treatment. In conclusion, this epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) in genetically identical twins identified a DMR in the TMEM232 promoter as a candidate loci associated with the clinical manifestation of MS. In addition, epigenetic biomarkers for MS treatments were identified, revealing that not only short-term, but also medium-term treatment effects are detectable in immune cells, which should be taken into account in future EWAS designs."

The field of complex trait genetics is shifting towards the study of low frequency and rare variants, which are hypothesised to have larger effects. The study of these variants can be empowered by focusing on isolated populations, in which rare variants may have increased in frequency and linkage disequilibrium tends to be extended. This work focuses on an isolated population from Crete, Greece.

Advanced paternal age is known to increase disease risk in offspring by increasing the number of DNMs in their genome. Less is known about the effect of assisted reproduction techniques (ART) on the number of DNMs in offspring. With the on-going trend of delayed parenthood more children are now born both from older fathers and through ART.
Materials and Methods: We investigated 49 trios (mother, father and child) and 2 quartets (mother, father and 2 siblings) divided into children born after spontaneous conception (n=18); born after in vitro fertilisation (IVF) (n=17) and born after intracytoplasmic sperm injection combined with testicular sperm extraction (ICSI-TESE) (n=18). Groups further divided by paternal age, young (&lt;35) or old (&gt;45 years of age at conception). Whole-genome sequencing was performed twice to independently detect and validate all DNMs in children.
Results: A clear paternal age effect was observed, with 70 DNMs detected on average in children born to young fathers and 94 DNMs in those born to older fathers (p = 0.001). No significant differences were observed between different methods of conception (p = 1) with paternal age affecting all methods equally.
Conclusions: Paternal age, not method of conception, had a major effect on the observed number of DNMs in offspring. Given the role DNMs in disease risk, this negative result is good news for IVF and ICSI-TESE born children, if replicated in larger cohorts."
EGAS00001003005,lymphocyte scrna seq,"As we age, our cells accumulate mutations, termed ""somatic mutations"". Somatic mutations, which exist in mosaic form throughout the body, are a direct record of the evolution of our cells. Some of these mutations are subject to neutral evolution. The study of neutral mutations can reveal the cell lineages resulting from normal development and tissue maintenance, and help us understand key demographic parameter of somatic evolution, such as population size and migration. Other mutations are under selection, resulting in the expansion or contraction of lineages. These mutations can lead to disease, such as cancer; however, the extent of selection on somatic mutations in not understood. We aim to understand the somatic evolution of the primary cells of the adaptive immune system, lymphocytes. As we age, lymphocytes accumulate somatic mutations, which reveal the evolutionary history of lymphocytes, as well as providing information about the particular mutations and lineage structures that contribute to age-related immune disorder. In order to understand somatic evolution in lymphocytes, we sequence lymphocytes from normal, healthy individuals across a range of ages. We perform whole-genome sequencing of single-cell derived T and B cell colonies to identify somatic mutations, and perform targeted deep-sequencing of these mutations. The lineages of T and B cells, and the frequencies of these mutations reveals the neutral and non-neutral evolutionary processes underlying lymphocyte growth.

Conventional response monitoring by imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology remains challenging and a marker for measurable residual disease (MRD) is lacking. Here, we show the clinical utility of CSF-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a biomarker of MRD in  serial samples collected from children with medulloblastoma (123 patients, 476 samples) enrolled on a prospective trial. Using low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, tumor-associated copy-number variations (CNVs) in CSF-derived cfDNA are investigated as an MRD surrogate. MRD is detected at baseline in 85% and 54% of patients with metastatic and localized disease, respectively. The number of MRD-positive patients decline with therapy, yet those with persistent MRD have significantly higher risk of progression. Importantly, MRD detection precedes radiographic progression in half who relapse. Our findings advocate for the prospective assessment of CSF-derived liquid biopsies in future trials for medulloblastoma."

We hypothesized that these factors increase the mutational burden in glandular tissue and may explain high cancer incidence rate in the general population and recurrent disease. Hence, we investigated the DNA sequence variants in the normal mammary gland, tumor and peripheral blood from 52 reportedly sporadic breast cancer patients, including breast-conserving surgery cases. Targeted resequencing of 542 cancer associated genes revealed mosaic somatic pathogenic variants of: PIK3CA, TP53, AKT1, MAP3K1, CDH1, RB1, NCOR1, MED12, CBFB, TBX3 and TSHR in the normal mammary gland, at considerable allelic frequencies (9x10-2 to 5.2x10-1) indicating clonal expansion. Further evaluation of the frequently damaged PIK3CA and TP53 genes by ultra-sensitive duplex sequencing demonstrated a diversified picture of multiple low level-mosaic (in 10-2 to 10-4 alleles) hotspot pathogenic variants. Our results raise a question about the oncogenic potential in non-tumor mammary gland tissue of breast-conserving surgery patients."

EGAS00001002153, subclonal architecture  metastatic breast cancer    prospective community based rapid autopsy program cascade,"Background: Understanding the cancer genome is seen as a key step in improving outcomes for cancer patients. Genomic assays are emerging as a possible avenue to personalised medicine in breast cancer. The majority of work in this area has targeted primary tumours however, and very few studies have performed comprehensive profiling of advanced disease. Evolution of the cancer genome during the natural history of breast cancer is largely unknown, as is the profile of disease at death. We sought to study in detail these aspects of advanced breast cancers that have resulted in lethal disease. Methods and Findings: Three patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer and one patient with triple negative breast cancer underwent rapid autopsy as part of an institutional prospective community-based rapid autopsy program. Cases represented a range of management problems in breast cancer, including late relapse after early stage disease; de novo metastatic disease; discordant disease response and disease refractory to treatment. Between 5 and 12 metastatic sites were collected at autopsy together with available primary tumours and longitudinal metastatic biopsies taken during life. Samples underwent paired tumour-normal whole exome sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. Subclonal architectures were inferred by jointly analysing all samples from each patient. Mutations were validated using high depth amplicon sequencing.Between cases, there were significant differences in mutational burden, driver mutations, mutational processes and copy number variation. Within each case, we found dramatic heterogeneity in subclonal structure from primary to metastatic disease and between metastatic sites, such that no single lesion captured the breadth of disease. Metastatic cross seeding was found in each case and treatment drove subclonal diversification. Subclones displayed parallel evolution of treatment resistance in some cases, and apparent augmentation of key oncogenic drivers as an alternative resistance mechanism. We also observed the key role of mutational processes in subclonal evolution.Limitations of this study include the potential for bias introduced by joint analysis of formalin fixed archival specimens with fresh specimens, and the difficulties in resolving subclones with whole exome sequencing. Other alterations that could define subclones such as structural variants or epigenetic modifications were not assessed. Conclusions: This study highlights the variety of mechanisms that shape the genome of metastatic breast cancer, and the value of studying advanced disease in detail. Treatment drives significant genomic heterogeneity in breast cancers which has implications for disease monitoring and treatment selection in the personalised medicine paradigm."

Here we identify monocyte-related CSF1R+Flt3- DCs that constitute about half of the SIRPα+ DCs in the steady-state human small intestine. CSF1R+Flt3- DCs express calprotectin and very low levels of CD14, are transcriptionally related to monocytes-derived cells, and accumulate during inflammation. CSF1R+Flt3- DCs are functionally distinct from their Flt3+ cDC counterparts: under steady-state conditions they excel at antigen uptake, show lower migratory potential, and are inefficient activators of naïve T cells. These results have important implications for the understanding of the ontogenetic and functional heterogeneity within human tissue DCs."

Biomarkers that reliably predict patient response to chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibition in gastric cancer are lacking. In this work, we used our machine learning algorithm NTriPath to identify a gastric-cancer specific 32-gene signature. Using unsupervised clustering on expression levels of these 32 genes in tumors from 567 patients, we identified four molecular subtypes that were prognostic for survival. We then built a support vector machine with linear kernel and the binary classifier to generate a risk score that is prognostic for 5-year overall survival and validated the risk score using three independent datasets. We also found that the molecular subtypes predicted response to adjuvant 5-fluorouracil and platinum after gastrectomy and immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with metastatic or recurrent disease. The 32-gene signature is a promising prognostic and predictive biomarker to guide the clinical care of gastric cancer patients and should be validated in a prospective manner.

We report the results of the PEMDAC phase 2 clinical trial (n=29; NCT02697630) where the HDAC inhibitor entinostat was combined with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab in  patients with metastatic UM. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), and was met with an ORR of 14%. The clinical benefit rate at 18 weeks was 28%, median progression free survival was 2.1 months and the median overall survival was 13.4 months. Toxicities were manageable, and there were no treatment-related deaths. Extensive genomics studies were performed using DNA/RNA and single cell sequencing and flow cytometry. Objective responses and prolonged survival were seen in three patients with BAP1 wildtype tumors, and in one patient with an iris melanoma that exhibited a UV signature. Longer survival also correlated with low baseline ctDNA levels or LDH. In conclusion, HDAC inhibition and anti-PD1 immunotherapy results in durable responses in a subset of patients with metastatic UM. Further exploration of combined immunotherapy and epigenetic therapy in metastatic UM is warranted."

Chromosome 18q11.2-q12.1 copy number status was measured and correlated with PFS according to a predefined analysis plan with marker-treatment interaction as the primary end-point.Results: Chromosome 18q11.2-q12.1 losses were detected in 71% of patients (181/256) characteristic for mCRC. Consistent with the non-randomized study, significant PFS benefit of bevacizumab was observed in chromosome 18q11.2-q12.1 loss patients (P=0.009), and not in 18q no-loss patients (P=0.67). Although significance for marker-treatment interaction was not reached (Pinteraction = 0.28), hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval (HRinteraction 0.72, CI 0.39 - 1.32) show striking overlap with the non-randomized study cohorts (HRinteraction 0.41, CI 0.32 - 0.8) supported by a non-significant Cochrane chi-squared (P=0.11) for heterogeneity. Conclusions: PFS characteristics for marker positive- and negative patients randomized for treatment with- or without bevacizumab were consistent with those of the non-randomized discovery study, though the number of AGITG-MAX samples fell short to reach significance for marker-treatment interaction. Post-hoc analysis of the AGITG-MAX RCT provides supportive evidence for chromosome 18q11.2-q12.1 as a clinically relevant predictive marker for mCRC patients."

Specifically, prior to treatment patients with metastatic disease will be recruited to a pilot study and blood collected for EV isolation with subsequent samples collected 3- and 12-months post-treatment. EVs will be isolated from blood plasma, RNA purified, and small RNA-sequencing carried out. Bioinformatic analysis will be performed in collaboration with Bart's and the London Genome Centre to identify changes in EV small RNA profiles across patients in response to treatment."
EGAS00001005709,combination immune checkpoint inhibition  australian rare cancers wes,"Combination immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 blockade has demonstrated significant clinical activity across tumour types. Rare cancer patients have limited treatment options due to the scarcity of studies of novel treatment options, so they are often offered chemotherapies untested in their disease.  ONJ2016-001/CA209-538 is a prospective, multicentre clinical trial of combination ICI (ipilimumab and nivolumab) in patients with advanced rare cancers, including biliary tract, adrenocortical, rare gynaecological and neuroendocrine cancers (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02923934). The primary endpoint is clinical benefit rate (complete response + partial response + stable disease &gt;3 months) by RECIST 1.1. This study involves generation and analysis of pre-treatment formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumour DNA sequencing data, paired with germline DNA sequencing data, to potentially identify genomic biomarkers that may associate with clinical benefit or other clinical efficacy / toxicity metrics."

Although the majority of these patients are successfully treated with surgery alone, a small proportion of patients have ‘born-to-be-bad’ aggressive lesions with early dissemination leading to distant metastases. Current standard of care histological assessment is unable to distinguish between these aggressive versus non-aggressive early lesions which is essential to provide appropriate clinical management decisions. This study aims to carry out molecular and histological profiling of approximately 300 T1 CRCs in order to develop a molecular stratifier based on the risk of relapse in early-invasive CRC. This novel T1 cohort will represent the world’s largest molecularly characterised T1 cohort of samples, with digital pathology assessment alongside whole exome sequencing, copy number variation analysis and 3’ RNA-seq. This data will be used to generate a robust panel of molecular and/or histological markers applicable to formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) archival tissue which discriminates between T1 lesions based on risk of relapse, which will ultimately be used to inform clinical management of CRC at the earliest stages of the disease."

EGAS00001005604,berlin neuroblastoma dataset update 2021,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a noncoding RNA class originating from alternative splicing, are highly abundant in neural tissues and were shown to regulate gene expression e.g. by interacting with microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Neuroblastoma is an embryonal neoplasia, which arises from undifferentiated neural crest cells. Here, we aimed to explore, whether circRNAs influence the pathogenesis of high-risk neuroblastoma. We performed whole-transcriptome sequencing of 104 primary neuroblastoma samples of all risk-groups and identified 5,203 unique circRNAs involving 2,302 genes. Candidate circRNA expression did not correlate with host gene expression, indicating independent regulatory mechanisms. circRNAs were significantly downregulated in the MYCN-amplified high-risk tumors. These findings were independently reproduced in a tetracycline-inducible MYCN-overexpression system based on a non MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell line, suggesting that MYCN drives this global circRNA repression. We identified the RNA helicase DHX9 as a mediator of this global suppressive effect of MYCN on circRNAs. Comparing our RNA sequencing data with other cancers and controls revealed a circRNA subset specifically upregulated in neuroblastoma that included a circRNA derived from the ARID1A tumor suppressor gene. Specific circARID1A knockdown resulted in reduced proliferation, cell numbers and viability, prompted apoptosis and induced a differentiated phenotype. Neither knockdown, nor overexpression of circARID1A influenced ARID1A mRNA and protein levels significantly. To dissect the potential mode of function, we performed a pulldown assay with subsequent mass spectrometry. We identified the RNA-binding protein KHSRP as an interaction partner that participates in the mechanism of action of circARID1A. In summary, this study highlights an important role of circRNAs in neuroblastoma biology and may establish this RNA class as a future therapeutic target and biomarker."

Endogenous glucocorticoids (GCs) are an essential part of the stress response, but this response varies between individuals, which may in turn affect clinical outcome in general, and post-operative inflammation, specifically. Exon 1 of the NR3C1 gene, encoding the glucocorticoid receptor, contains an established region of differential regulation. DNA methylation patterns in this region have been found to differ between individuals. We investigated the methylation status and genotype in the Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) island in exon 1 of NR3C1 in 24 patients who underwent major abdominal surgery and correlated it with post-operative complications. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and underwent targeted bisulfite sequencing of the CpG island. Complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification and 14 out of 24 had post-operative complications.  Multifactorial and partial least square methods were used to analyse the data.  A homogenous demethylated pattern was observed in all patients and no single CpG methylation was associated with post-operative complications. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were significantly correlated with higher Clavien-Dindo scores. Genetic variability in the chr5:143,402,505-143,405,805 region of exon 1 of the glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1, but not DNA methylation, was associated with more severe post-operative complications in patients having major abdominal surgery.

This finding is somewhat paradoxical since the genetic differences between IDH-mutant astrocytomas and IDH-mutant oligodendrogliomas are prognostic, predictive of therapeutic response, and correlated with differences in immune infiltrates. To integrate these disparate findings, we constructed a single-cell atlas of 22 human IDH-mutant primary untreated grade-II/III gliomas."
EGAS00001005736,mult omics palbociclib resistance study  hr her2 metastatic breast cancer,"Resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors and endocrine therapy (ET) are common and poorly understood since they have been real game changer in patients with HR-positive and HER2-negative MBC. A comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic analysis of pre-treatment and post-treatment tumors from patients treated with palbociclib plus ET identified novel markers associated with poor prognosis such as genomic scar features caused by homologous repair deficiency (HRD), estrogen response signatures, and four unique prognostic clusters with distinct molecular features. Tumors with TP53 mutations co-occurring with a unique HRD-high cluster responded poorly. By comparing genomic and transciptomic profiles of paired samples, tumors were found to be further enriched in HRD genomic scars and many had switched to aggressive molecular subtypes. Furthermore, we identified high frequencies of acquired genomic alterations upon disease progression in RB1, ESR1, PTEN, and KMT2C. Our findings provide new insight into potential predictive biomarkers that could be targeted to overcome resistance. (NCT03401359)"

Herein, we report results from a randomized phase II study of neoadjuvant nivolumab versus combined ipilimumab with nivolumab in 23 patients with high-risk resectable melanoma (NCT02519322). RECIST overall response rates (ORR), pathologic complete response rates (pCR), treatment-related adverse events (trAEs), and immune correlates of response were assessed. Treatment with combined ipilimumab and nivolumab yielded high response rates (RECIST ORR 73%, pCR 45%) but substantial toxicity (73% grade 3 trAEs), whereas treatment with nivolumab monotherapy yielded modest responses (ORR 25%, pCR 25%) and low toxicity (8% grade 3 trAEs). Immune correlates of response were identified, demonstrating higher lymphoid infiltrates in responders to both therapies and a more clonal and diverse T cell infiltrate in responders to nivolumab monotherapy. These results are the first to describe the feasibility of neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade in melanoma and emphasize the need for additional studies to optimize treatment regimens and to validate putative biomarkers."

T-cell lymphoma is a type of NHL that develops from T lymphocytes and accounts for 10-15% of total NHL cases. As a rare disease, T-cell lymphoma is functionally, pathologically, and clinically complex and heterogeneous. The 2016 revision of the WHO classification has listed 29 subtypes of mature T/NK-cell neoplasms, among which over 25 are T lymphocyte in origin. These subtypes of T-cell lymphomas have different biological behaviours and clinical prognosis.   Clinically, T-cell lymphoma ranges from indolent (slow-growing) to aggressive (fast-growing and spreading) disease. According to the guideline booklet provided by the Lymphoma Research Foundation (https://lymphoma.org/aboutlymphoma/nhl/), indolent T-cell lymphoma subtypes include adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL), cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), and mycosis fungoides (MF), while the aggressive subtypes include anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), and T lymphoblastic lymphoma (TLBL). PTCL and ALCL represent the most common subtypes of aggressive T-cell lymphoma whereas TLBL is a rare and aggressive subtype mostly diagnosed in children. In this study, we will use single cell RNA sequencing and single cell multiomic methods three aggressive T-cell lymphoma subtypes (ALCL, PTCL and TLBL) and try to gain a deeper insight into the genotypic and phenotypic features of these T-cell lymphomas."

Histologically, tumours of the skin may arise from epithelium, including epidermis, hair follicle, sebaceous or sweat gland, melanocytes, dermal-associated mesenchymal structures or tissue resident immune cells, making for a diversity of clinical presentations. Importantly, many skin tumour types have an extremely poor prognosis.  Many skin tumour subtypes have never undergone molecular profiling, or if they have, targeted sequencing has been used and the number of cases analyzed has been so limited that deriving firm conclusions about the profile of driver genes, DNA mutational signatures and germline alleles has not been possible
       For 70 key skin tumour subtypes defined by the World Health Organization, that have not undergone extensive genetic analysis previoulsy, we propose to perform whole exome and transcriptome sequencing, from a range of body sites, to build a genomic atlas of dermatological tumours, including detailed maps of SNVs, copy number alterations, genome-wide methylation and expression profiles.

EGAS00001005575, microenvironment  small intestinal neuroendocrine tumours  lymphocytes capable  recognition  activation  expansion,"Traditionally, immune evasion and immunotherapy have been studied in cancers with a high mutational load such as melanoma or lung cancer. In contrast, small intestinal neuroendocrine tumours (SINETs) present a low frequency of somatic mutations and are described as genetically stable tumours, rendering immunotherapies largely unchartered waters for SINET patients. SINETs frequently metastasise to the regional lymph nodes and liver at the time of diagnosis, and no curative treatments are currently available for patients with disseminated disease. Here, we characterised the immune landscape of SINET and demonstrated that tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) can be expanded and activated during autologous tumour challenge. The composition of lymphocyte subsets was determined by immunophenotyping of the SINET microenvironment in one hepatic and six lymph node metastases. TILs from these metastases were successfully grown out, enabling immunophenotyping and assessment of PD-1 expression. Expansion of the TILs and exposure to autologous tumour cells in vitro resulted in increased T lymphocyte degranulation. This study provides insights into the largely unknown SINET immune landscape and reveals the anti-tumour reactivity of TILs, which might merit adoptive T cell transfer as a feasible treatment option for patients with SINET."
EGAS00001005596,genetics  therapeutic responses   therapy  pancreatic cancer pdx models,"Pancreatic cancer is the 7th leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Checkpoint immunotherapy has not yet showed encouraging results in pancreatic cancer possibly owing to a poor immunogenicity and/or an immune suppressive microenvironment. The aim of this study was to develop patient-derived xenografts (PDX) models and to assess if autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) would have anti-tumoral activity in pancreatic cancer. Tumor biopsies from 29 patients were subcutaneously transplanted into NOG mice. Tumor growths were confirmed in 11 out of 29 transplantations. The PDX tumors histologically resembled their original biopsies, but since stromal cells in the PDX model tumors were from mouse, their gene expression differed from the original biopsies. Immune checkpoint ligands other than PD-L1 were expressed in pancreatic cancers but PD-L1 was rarely expressed. One of the three tumors that did express PD-L1 was an adenosquamous cancer and another had a mismatch repair deficiency. TILs were expanded from six tumors and were injected into NOG or human interleukin-2 transgenic-NOG (hIL2-NOG) mice carrying PDX tumors. Regression of tumors could be verified in hIL2-NOG mice in 3 of the 6 PDX models treated with autologous TILs, including the adenosquamous PDX model. In conclusion, PDX models of pancreatic cancer can be used to learn more about tumor characteristics and biomarkers, and to evaluate responses to ACT and combination therapies. The major benefit of the model is that modifications of T cells can be tested in an autologous humanized mouse model to gain preclinical data to support the initiation of a clinical trial."

EGAS00001005761,exome sequencing,"Human telomere biology disorders (TBD), a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by telomere attrition and premature aging phenotypes, are caused by inherited loss-of-function mutations in telomere-associated genes. Here, we identify three germline heterozygous missense variants in RPA1 gene in four unrelated probands presenting with short telomeres and varying clinical features of TBD including bone marrow failure, myelodysplastic syndrome, T- and B-cell lymphopenia, pulmonary fibrosis, and skin manifestations. All variants cluster to DNA binding domain A of RPA1 protein. RPA1 is an essential single-strand DNA-binding protein essential for DNA replication and repair. RPA1 has been implicated in telomere maintenance but the mechanism remains elusive. Thus far, no genetic disorder had been linked to RPA1. Using FRET assays, we showed that RPA1E240K and RPA1V227A exhibit increased binding to single-strand and telomeric DNA, implying a gain in DNA-binding function while RPA1T270A has binding properties similar to wild type. To study the mutational effect, RPA1E240K, with the highest binding capacity, was knocked-in iPSCs using CRISPR/Cas9, which showed severe telomere shortening and impaired hematopoietic differentiation. Furthermore, in the RPA1E240K patient, stable blood counts over two decades due coincided with clonal rescue hematopoiesis with an RNA-degrading truncating RPA1 mutation and a uniparental isodisomy 17p with loss of RPA1E240K allele. Using single cell DNA sequencing, the two somatic genetic rescue events were proven to be independently acquired in hematopoietic stem cells. In summary, we describe the first human disease caused by germline RPA1 variants in individuals with TBD."

Here, we investigate potential transmission and persistence of familial microbiome patterns and microbial genotypes in a family cohort (N=102) spanning three to five generations over the same female bloodline. We observe microbiome community composition to be associated with kinship, with seven (low-abundant) genera displaying familial distribution patterns. While kinship and current cohabitation emerged as closely entangled variables, our explorative analyses of microbial genotype distribution and transmission estimates point at the latter as a key covariate of strain dissemination. Highest potential transmission rates are estimated between sisters and mother-daughter pairs, decreasing with increasing daughter’s age, and being higher among cohabiting pairs than those living apart. Although rare, we do detect potential transmission events spanning three and four generations, primarily involving species of the genera Alistipes and Bacteroides. Overall, while our analyses confirm the existence of family-bound microbiome community profiles, transmission or co-acquisition of bacterial strains appears to be strongly linked to cohabitation."

Here we performed single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) employing both short (Illumina) and long-read (Pacific Biosciences) sequencing technologies on a total of 29 DS and non-DS control prefrontal cortex samples. In DS, the ratio of inhibitory-to-excitatory neurons was significantly increased, which was not observed in previous reports examining sporadic AD.  DS microglial transcriptomes displayed AD-related aging and activation signatures in advance of AD neuropathology, with increased microglial expression of C1q complement genes (associated with dendritic pruning) and the HSA21 transcription factor gene RUNX1.  Long-read sequencing detected vast RNA isoform diversity within and amongst specific cell types including numerous novel sequences that differed between DS and normal brains.

We report the results of the phase 2 PrE0505 trial (NCT02899195) of the anti-PD-L1 antibody, durvalumab, plus platinum-based and pemetrexed chemotherapy for patients with previously untreated unresectable pleural mesothelioma. The primary endpoint was overall survival compared to historic control with cisplatin and pemetrexed chemotherapy. The combination of durvalumab with chemotherapy met the pre-specified primary endpoint reaching a median survival of 20.4 months vs. 12.1 months with historic control. Treatment emergent adverse events were consistent with known side effects of chemotherapy and all adverse events due to immunotherapy were grade ≤2. Integrated genomic and immune cell repertoire analyses revealed that a higher immunogenic mutation burden coupled with a more diverse T cell repertoire were linked with favorable clinical outcome. Structural genome-wide analyses demonstrated a higher degree of genomic instability in responding tumors of epithelioid histology. Patients with germline alterations in cancer predisposing genes, especially those involved in DNA repair, were more likely to attain long term survival. Our findings indicate that concurrent durvalumab with platinum-based chemotherapy has promising clinical activity and that responses are driven by the complex genomic background of malignant pleural mesothelioma."

Colorectal adenocarcinomas primarily metastasize into the liver and (less often) into the peritoneum. Patients suffering from CRC-liver metastasis (CRC-LM) typically present with a dismal overall survival compared to non-metastasized CRC patients. The metastasis process and metastasis promoting factors in patients with CRC are under intensive debate. However, CRC studies investigating the proteome biology are lacking. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens provide a valuable resource for comprehensive proteomic studies of a broad variety of clinical malignancies. The presented pilot study compares the proteome of primary CRC and patient-matched CRC-LM. The applied protocol allows a reproducible and straightforward identification and quantification of over 2,600 proteins within the dissected tumorous tissue. Subsequent unsupervised clustering reveals distinct proteome biologies of the primary CRC and the corresponding CRC-LM. Statistical analysis yields multiple differentially abundant proteins in either primary CRC or their corresponding liver metastases. A more detailed analysis of dysregulated biological processes suggests an active immune response in the liver metastases, including several proteins of the complement system. Proteins with structural roles, e.g. cytoskeleton organization or cell junction assembly appear to be less prominent in liver metastases as compared to primary CRC. Immunohistochemistry corroborates proteomic high expression levels of metabolic proteins in CRC-LM. We further assessed how the in vitro inhibition of two in CRC-LM enriched metabolic proteins affected cell proliferation and chemosensitivity. The presented proteomic investigation in a small clinical cohort promotes a more comprehensive understanding of the distinct proteome biology of primary CRC and their corresponding liver metastases."

Early genetic studies hinted that airway epithelial cells play an important role in the development of IPF while more recent single-cell RNA sequencing atlases from explant IPF lungs have focused on macrophages. In this study, we used air-liquid interface cultures of primary cells taken from the subsegmental bronchi of IPF patients, reflecting early-stage fibrosis, to interrogate the single-cell transcriptional landscape of the airway mucosa. We identified IPF-enriched cell-cell interaction pathways. Moreover, we also observed that IPF cell types shared “core” signatures, where epithelial cells had a pro-inflammatory signature while fibroblasts had an early activation signature. Harnessing the in vitro culture system, we also treated the cells with nintedanib, pirfenidone, and saracatinib, an Src kinase inhibitor that could inhibit IPF progression, to investigate their effects on the previously described IPF signatures. Unfortunately, only certain signatures were positively affected by the three drugs. This study provides more insight into the disease mechanisms of IPF and is a key resource for the IPF community to further investigate the effects of pharmacological inhibition."
EGAS00001004666,genomic analysis  patient derived xenograft models reveals intratumor heterogeneity  endometrial cancer   predict tumor growth inhibition  talazoparib,"Background: Endometrial cancer (EC) is a major gynecological cancer with increasing incidence. It comprised of four molecular subtypes with differing etiology, prognoses, and response to chemotherapy. In the future, clinical trials testing new single agents or combination therapies will be targeted to the molecular subtype most likely to respond. Pre-clinical models that faithfully represent the molecular subtypes of EC are urgently needed, we sought to develop and characterize a panel of novel EC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models.

Methods: Here, we report whole exome or whole genome sequencing of 11 PDX models and the matched primary tumor. Analysis of multiple PDX lineages and passages was performed to study tumor heterogeneity across lineages and/or passages. Based on recent reports of frequent defects in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway in EC, we assessed mutational signatures and HR deficiency scores and correlated these with in vivo responses to the PARP inhibitor (PARPi) talazoparib in six PDXs representing the copy number high/p53-mutant and mismatch-repair deficient molecular subtypes of EC.

Results: PDX models were successfully generated with similar histomorphology from all four molecular subtypes of EC and uterine carcinosarcomas. We also observed a wide range of inter-tumor and intra-tumor heterogeneity across different PDX lineages, however one arm of most PDX models recapitulated the molecular landscape of the primary tumor without major genomic drift. An in vivo response to talazoparib was detected in four copy number high models. Two models (carcinosarcomas) showed a response consistent with stable disease and two models (one copy number high serous EC and another carcinosarcoma) showed significant tumor growth inhibition, albeit one consistent with progressive disease, however all lacked the HR deficiency genomic signature. 

Conclusions: EC PDX models represent the four molecular subtypes of disease and can capture intra-tumoral heterogeneity of the original primary tumor. PDXs of the copy number high molecular subtype showed sensitivity to PARPi, however, deeper and more durable responses will likely require combination of PARPi with other agents."

Our lab is ideally positioned to investigate this question, due to tools like Nanorate sequencing20 and LCM and low-input DNA sequencing. Firstly, I am going to use LCM sequencing to study whether there is any clonality in the atherosclerotic tissue and approximately when this process started in the individual’s life.

We therefore investigated the mechanisms of selection in childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) during induction chemotherapy where maximal cytoreduction occurs. To distinguish stochastic versus deterministic events, individual leukemias were transplanted into multiple xenografts and chemotherapy administered. Analyses of the immediate post-treatment leukemic residuum at single-cell resolution revealed that chemotherapy has little impact on genetic heterogeneity. Rather, it acts on extensive, previously unappreciated, transcriptional and epigenetic heterogeneity in BCP-ALL, dramatically reducing the spectrum of cell states represented, leaving a genetically polyclonal but phenotypically uniform population, with hallmark signatures relating to developmental stage, cell cycle and metabolism. Hence, canalization of the cell state accounts for a significant component of bottleneck selection during induction chemotherapy."

However, here we demonstrate that a much higher frequency population of chemoresistant neuroblastoma cells can arise when the influence of gene expression noise is integrated across multiple components of a signalling network. Using a c-Jun N-Terminal Kinase (JNK) activity biosensor with longitudinal high-content and in vivo intravital imaging, we reveal thestochasticity of chemotherapy-induced apoptotic signalling and confirm the existence of a population of JNK-impaired, chemoresistant cells that exist due to noise in components of this signalling network. Further, we demonstrate that a memory of this initially random resistant state is retained following treatment, achieved through maintenance of a repressive chromatin state. Using matched patient-derived xenograft models established at diagnosis and relapse from individual patients, we also demonstrate that priming neuroblastoma cells with a histone deacetylase inhibitor can restore drug-induced JNK activity within the chemoresistant population of treatment naïve tumours, but does not erase the memory of this resistant state from relapsed or refractory tumours."

We analysed serial samples from 171 SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with a range of disease severities together with 63 vaccine recipients, and found marked differences in the global BCR repertoire after natural infection compared to vaccination. Following infection, the proportion of BCRs bearing IgG1/3 and IgA1 isotypes increased, somatic hypermutation (SHM) was markedly decreased and, in patients with severe disease, expansion of IgM and IgA clones was observed. In contrast, after vaccination the proportion of BCRs bearing IgD/M isotypes increased, SHM was unchanged and expansion of IgG clones was prominent. Infection generated a broad distribution of SARS-CoV-2-specific clones predicted to target the spike protein whilst vaccination produced a more focused response mainly targeting the spike’s receptor-binding domain. These findings offer insights into how different immune exposure to SARS-CoV-2 impacts upon BCR repertoire development, potentially informing vaccine strategies."

To evaluate the molecular features that make prostate tumors visible to mpMRI, we established an mpMRI-blind multicore collection and performed low pass whole genome, exome, transcriptome and methylation profiling of 14 lesions and 23 representative cores from 6 PCa patients. Our results show that diagnosis based on mpMRI does not capture the genomic complexity of tumors, and reveal that commercial prognostic signature results based on single-biopsy assessments are insufficient to define risk of progression. Altogether, our study supports the use of a multi-biopsy assessment in both mpMRI visible and non-visible areas in order to provide a truly personalised diagnosis"

EGAS00001003459,profiling  sf188 atrx isogenic glioma cells,"Paediatric glioblastoma (pGBM) and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) harbour frequent alterations in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling gene ATRX (α-thalassemia mental retardation X-linked), although the precise role of ATRX in tumorigenesis remains unclear. We sought to explore this using genomic analysis of patient samples, CRISPR-Cas9 engineered isogenic ATRX knockout (KO) pGBM cell lines and primary patient-derived cultures. ATRX loss of function resulted in a range of transcriptional changes linked to distinct epigenetic mechanisms. These included differential dysregulation of gene expression on the sex chromosomes, as well as loci associated with maternal imprinting. ATRX loss conferred reduced H3K9 trimethylation, and in turn an abrogated DNA repair capacity which resulted in stalled replication forks. Drug screening of isogenic and patient-derived cultures in vitro identified multiple chemotypes of PARP inhibitor to be differentially sensitive in ATRX-deficient cells, and to produce a pronounced radiosensitization related to a reduction of the ATM modulator APPL2. Using an in vivo orthotopic model of pGBM, treatment of ATRX-KO tumour-bearing mice with combined olaparib and radiation resulted in a significant prolongation of survival not observed in ATRX wild-type tumours. These data suggest a rational approach to target ATRX-deficient pGBM based upon the altered epigenetic control of the DNA damage response, and may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for these highly aggressive tumours."

Within Mutographs, work lead by the Sanger Institute will investigate whether detection of somatic mutations and mutational signatures in circulating white blood cells can be developed into a practical, generic system for surveying and monitoring multiple different endogenous and exogenous exposures, providing an ‘observatory’ on somatic mutational processes in humans.

Whole genome sequences are generated at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (Illumina HiSeqX). Somatic mutational signatures are subsequently extracted by non-negative matrix factorisation methods. 
Through an enhanced understanding of cancer aetiology, Mutographs unprecedented effort is anticipated to outline modifiable risk factors, lead to new approaches to prevent cancer, and provide opportunities to empower early detection, refine high-risk groups and contribute to further therapeutic development."

Therefore, the Lunenburg Lymphoma Biomarker Consortium (LLBC) performed a validation study for published markers. Methods: To maximize sensitivity, an end-of-spectrum design was applied for 122 uniformly immunochemotherapy-treated FL patients retrieved from international trials and registries; early failure (EF): progression or lymphoma-related death &lt;2 years versus long remission: response duration of &gt;5 years. IHC staining for T-cells and macrophages was performed on tissue microarrays from initial biopsy and scored with a validated computer-assisted protocol. Shallow whole-genome and deep targeted sequencing was performed on the same samples.  Results: 96/122 cases with complete molecular and immunohistochemical data were included in the analysis. EZH2 wild-type (p=0.006), gain of chromosome 18 (p=0.002), low percentages of CD8+ cells (p=0.011) and CD163+ areas (p=0.038) were associated with EF. No significant differences in other markers were observed, thereby refuting previous claims on their prognostic significance.  Conclusion: Using an optimized study design, this LLBC study validates wild-type EZH2 status, gain of chromosome 18, low percentages of CD8+ cells and CD163+ area as predictors of EF to immunochemotherapy in FL."

genetic backgrounds, batch to batch experimental variablility poses a significant challenge,
especially when trying to identify smaller effects. One way to address this issue is to
differentiate several different lines in the same culture dish, thereby elimating experimental
variation. In addition, it allows researchers to analyze many more lines with less experiments.
Parallel single cell RNA-Seq exploits that individual cells are tagged and hence each cell can
be reliably assigned to the donor of origin based on the genetic variants it contains. In
addition, analyzing the genetic signature of single cells within a differentiating population can
reveal differentation stages that are not easily detected in bulk RNAseq data.

Somatic mutations in  blood progenitors can provide insight into the rate and processes underlying this accumulation, as well as the developmental lineage tree and stem cell division numbers. Here, we catalogue somatic mutations in the genomes of human bone marrow-derived and cord blood-derived hematopoietic stem and multipotent progenitor cells (HSPCs) and find that base substitutions accumulate with approximately 17 base substitutions per year in both populations, while insertions and deletions occur sporadically and at low numbers. The majority of mutations in adult HSPCs were acquired after birth and could be explained by the constant activity of various endogenous processes, which also explains the mutation load in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We construct a developmental lineage tree revealing a polyclonal architecture of the hematopoietic progenitor compartment and providing evidence that developmental clones exhibit multipotency, though lineage biases can be detected. Our approach highlights novel features of human native hematopoiesis and its implications for leukemogenesis."

EGAS00001003350,alpi deficiency  refractory inflammation bowel disease,"Herein, we report the first identification of biallelic-inherited mutations in ALPI as a Mendelian cause of inflammatory bowel disease in two unrelated patients. ALPI encodes for intestinal phosphatase alkaline, a brush border metalloenzyme that hydrolyses phosphate from the lipid A moiety of lipopolysaccharides and thereby drastically reduces Toll-like receptor 4 agonist activity. Prediction tools and structural modelling indicate that all mutations affect critical residues or inter-subunit interactions, and heterologous expression in HEK293T cells demonstrated that all ALPI mutations were loss of function. ALPI mutations impaired either stability or catalytic activity of ALPI and rendered it unable to detoxify lipopolysaccharide-dependent signalling. Furthermore, ALPI expression was reduced in patients' biopsies, and ALPI activity was undetectable in ALPI-deficient patient's stool. Our findings highlight the crucial role of ALPI in regulating host-microbiota interactions and restraining host inflammatory responses. These results indicate that ALPI mutations should be included in screening for monogenic causes of inflammatory bowel diseases and lay the groundwork for ALPI-based treatments in intestinal inflammatory disorders."

Here we report de novo missense mutations in DNMT3A, encoding the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A, that cause microcephalic dwarfism, a hypocellular disorder of extreme global growth failure. Substitutions in the PWWP domain abrogate binding to the histone modifications H3K36me2/3, and alter DNA methylation in patient cells. Polycomb-associated DNA methylation canyons/valleys, hypomethylated domains encompassing developmental genes, become methylated with concomitant depletion of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 bivalent marks. Such de novo DNA methylation occurs during differentiation of Dnmt3aW326R pluripotent cells in vitro, and is also evident in Dnmt3aW326R/+ dwarf mice. We therefore propose that the interaction of the DNMT3A PWWP domain with H3K36me2/3 normally limits DNA methylation of polycomb-marked regions.  Our findings implicate the interplay between DNA methylation and polycomb at key developmental regulators as a determinant of organism size in mammals."

Surprisingly, although TG mutations were not exclusive to mutations in the RAS-MAP kinase pathway, their presence was associated with a significantly worse clinical outcome, which suggests a pathogenic role beyond driving initial oncogenesis.  Analysis of metastatic PTC tissue revealed significant enrichment for TG mutations (p&lt;0.001), including events of apparent clonal expansion.  Our results suggest a previously unknown role of TG somatic mutations in the pathogenesis of PTC and its malignant evolution."

We tested whether CAR19-engineering of the CD1d-restricted invariant NKT (iNKT) cells would result in enhanced anti-lymphoma activity. CAR19-iNKT cells co-operatively activated by CD1d- and CAR19-CD19-dependent interactions are more effective than CAR19-T cells against CD1d-expressing lymphomas in vitro and in vivo. The swifter in vivo anti-lymphoma activity of CAR19-iNKT cells and their enhanced ability to eradicate brain lymphomas underpinned an improved tumor-free and overall survival. CD1d transcriptional de-repression by all-trans retinoic acid results in further enhanced cytotoxicity of CAR19-iNKT cells against CD19+ chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. Thus, iNKT cells are a highly efficient platform for CAR-based immunotherapy of lymphomas and possibly other CD1d-expressing cancers."

Here, we report on another UM patient who carried an MBD4 germline nonsense variant (p.Leu563Ter) and her tumour showed a 5-fold higher than average mutation burden. We confirmed the association between germline loss-of-function variant in MBD4 and CI response. The patient experienced stable disease (10 months) and survived two years with metastatic disease, which is twice as long as median survival. Additionally, the frequency of MBD4 loss-of-function variants in reported UM cohorts was &gt;20 times higher than in an aggregated population genome database (P &lt; 5x10-5), implying a potential role as UM predisposition gene. These findings provide a strong basis for the inclusion of MBD4 in screening of potential UM-prone families as well as stratification of immunotherapy."

The CC will be consolidated under the auspices of the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) and the International Network for the Demographic Evaluation of Populations and Their Health in Developing Countries (INDEPTH). It will capitalize on the unique strengths of existing longitudinal cohorts, including the urban Soweto and rural Agincourt studies in South Africa (Wits based), and the well established INDEPTH demographic health and surveillance centers in Kenya, Ghana, Burkina Faso and South Africa. The centers offer established infrastructure, trained fieldworkers, long-standing community engagement, and detailed longitudinal phenotypic data, focusing on obesity and cardiometabolic health. Key strengths are harmonized phenotyping across sites, building on strong existing cohorts, and representation of the geographic and social variability of African populations. We aim to: 1. Build sustainable infrastructure (biobanks and laboratories) and capabilities (well characterized population cohorts, genotyping and bioinformatics) for genomic research on the African continent; 2. Understand the genomic architecture of sub-Saharan populations from west, east and south Africa to guide genomic studies (genome sequencing and high throughput SNP and CNV arrays using unrelated individuals and family trios to improve the accuracy of haplotype analyses) and; 3. Investigate the independent and synergistic genomic contributions to body fat distribution (BMI, hip/waist circumference, subcutaneous and visceral fat) in these populations considering the relevant environmental and social contexts (rural/urban communities, quickly transitioning obesity prevalence, differential HIV, TB, and malaria infection histories). We will investigate the effect of obesity and fat distribution on the risk for CMD in the longitudinal cohorts. The CC will draw upon a wide group of highly experienced African scientists and international collaborators to ensure the success of its vision.Lay Description: This Wits-INDEPTH H3Africa Collaborative Centre (CC) under the leadership of Drs.

MMs frequently present late and have a poor prognosis; the 5-year survival rate is only 14%. MM makes up only ~1.4% of all melanomas and it is this rarity that makes knowledge of the genetic changes that contribute to its pathogenesis limited to a small number of exome/genome studies and other targeted studies. Thus to investigate the somatic alterations and mutation spectra in MM genomes, we have extracted genomic DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human MMs, and subjected them to whole exome sequencing. Given the propensity of MM to metastasize, we will also be sequencing metastatic MM lesions; primary and metastatic lesions from the same individual represent an excellent opportunity to identify potential drivers of metastasis in MM. Finally we will sequence ‘normal’ DNA from the same individual, where possible, to exclude germline variations."

However, these technologies need to be further improved with regard to reproducibility and applicability to clinical samples and settings. Methods: Using identification of genetic variations in prostate cancer as an example we address three crucial challenges in the field of targeted re-sequencing: Small nucleotide variation (SNV) detection in samples of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue material, minimal amount of input sample and sampling in view of tissue heterogeneity.Results: We show that FFPE tissue material can supplement for fresh frozen tissues for the detection of SNVs and that solution-based enrichment experiments can be accomplished with small amounts of DNA with only minimal effects on enrichment uniformity and data variance. Finally, we address the question whether the heterogeneity of a tumor is reflected by different genetic alterations, e.g. different foci of a tumor display different genomic patterns. We show that the tumor heterogeneity plays an important role for the detection of copy number variations, but is of minor importance for the detection of somatic variations.Conclusions: The application of high throughput sequencing technologies in cancer genomics opens up a new dimension for the identification of disease mechanisms. In particular the ability to use small amounts of FFPE samples available from surgical tumor resections and histopathological examinations facilitates the collection of precious tissue materials. However, care needs to be taken in regard to the locations of the biopsies taken, which can have an influence on the prediction of copy number variations. Bearing these technological challenges in mind will significantly improve many large-scale sequencing studies and will - on a long-range - result in a more reliable prediction of individual cancer therapies."""

We performed single-cell sequencing of more than 3900 normal fallopian tube epithelial (FTE) cells, the presumed cells of origin of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and identified six molecular FTE subtypes. We show that individual serous ovarian carcinomas can be classified based on their deconvolution into constituent FTE molecular subtypes.

We observed that telomere maintenance and mutations in RAS or p53 pathway genes strongly affected disease courses. Fatal outcome occurred only in the presence of telomere maintenance, whereas patients whose tumors lacked such mechanisms had excellent outcome. In patients with telomere maintenance-positive tumors, survival was dramatically inferior when additional RAS/p53 pathway mutations were present. By contrast, spontaneous regression occurred both in the presence and absence of RAS/p53 pathway mutations in patients with telomere maintenance-negative tumors. Together, our data provide a precise mechanistic classification of clinical neuroblastoma phenotypes based on telomere maintenance mechanisms and genetic alterations of the tumor."
EGAS00001003370,mutational patterns  metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma,"Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) from the head and neck typically metastasizes to the lymph nodes of the neck and parotid glands. When a primary is not identified, they are difficult to distinguish from metastases of mucosal origin and primary salivary gland SCC. Ultraviolet radiation causes a mutation pattern that predominantly features cytosine to thymine transitions at dipyrimidine sites and has been associated with cSCC. In this study, we used whole genome sequencing data from 15 cSCC metastases and show that a UV signature mutation is pervasive across the cohort and distinct from mucosal SCC. The mutational burden was exceptionally high and concentrated in some regions of the genome, especially insulator elements (mean 162 mutations / Mb). We therefore evaluated the likely impact of UV-induced mutations on the dipyrimidine rich binding site of the main human insulator protein, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), and the possible implications on CTCF function and the spatial organization of the genome. Our findings suggest that mutation signature analysis may be useful in determining the origin of metastases in the neck and the parotid gland. Furthermore, UV-induced DNA damage to insulator binding sites may play a role in the carcinogenesis and progression of cSCC."

However, human embryonic and fetal tissues are not readily accessible. Cell-free fetal DNA molecules are present in maternal circulation. We applied genome-wide bisulfite sequencing to analyze the methylation profile of maternal plasma DNA at single nucleotide resolution. By exploiting the polymorphic differences between the mother and the fetus, we showed that genome scale fetal methylomic analysis could be performed using maternal blood samples. Due to the noninvasive nature of this approach, we were able to serially assess the fetal and maternal plasma methylomes from maternal blood samples collected in the first trimester, third trimester and after delivery. Gestation-related changes were observed. The fetal methylome deduced from maternal plasma resembled the placental methylome both on a genome-wide level as well as on a per CpG site basis. Imprinted genes and differentially methylated regions were identified from the maternal plasma data. We demonstrated one potential clinical application of maternal plasma bisulfite sequencing with the successful detection of fetal trisomy 21. We have therefore developed an approach to study the fetal methylome noninvasively, serially and comprehensively.

EGAS00001003373,german early onset prostate cancer cohort   pan prostate cancer genome ppcg project,"Prostate cancer is the most frequent malignant tumor in males and the second most frequent cause of cancer-related death. Currently, in Germany, more than 60,000 prostate cancers are diagnosed every year. Although most of these patients are treated in a curative attempt, more than 10,000 German men die from prostate cancer annually. Owing to the demographic changes of our society, a further doubling of prostate cancer incidences during the next 20 years is expected. Prostate cancer is generally considered a tumor of elderly men. However, a fraction of prostate cancers are diagnosed at the age of 55 years or less. For several reasons, these “early onset prostate cancers” may represent a key entity for the understanding of prostate cancer biology. First, it is likely that early onset prostate cancers represent a distinct molecular subgroup of prostate cancer (PCa), potentially characterized by relatively small numbers of genetic changes, some of which may be particularly strong driver mutations for PCa development. Second, a fraction of prostate cancers in young individuals could represent classical prostate cancers that are detected at a very early stage and might therefore have accumulated molecular changes/mutations occurring that are most instrumental for prostate cancer early detection. Third, PCa with hereditary backgrounds are likely to accumulate in the age group below 55 years. A comparison with other sample sets (e.g. from other ICGC consortia), a systematic genomic analysis of young men with PCa could therefore lead to the detection of mechanisms for hereditary PCa. Fourth, a better understanding of these tumors is particularly relevant as finding optimal treatment regimens is most critical in young cancer patients. We are analyzing the entire genomic DNA sequences of at least 200 PCas (and matched non-tumorous DNA) of young men (≤ 55y), to at least 30 fold coverage, and integrate single-nucleotide variants and genomic structural variations with differential methylation, mRNA and miRNA expression data.Tissues were collected at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf.

We examined the sensitivity of TMB assessment to bioinformatic filtering methods and assessed concordance between TMB data derived by WES and the FoundationOne CDx™ assay. TMB scores comprising synonymous, indel, frameshift, and nonsense mutations (all mutations) were 3.1-fold higher than data including missense mutations only, but values were highly correlated (Spearman’s r = 0.99). Scores from CheckMate 026 samples including missense mutations only were similar to those generated from data in The Cancer Genome Atlas, but those including all mutations were generally higher. Using databases for germline subtraction (instead of matched controls) showed a trend for race-dependent increases in TMB scores. Parameter variation can therefore impact TMB calculations, highlighting the need for standardization. Encouragingly, WES and FoundationOne CDx outputs were highly correlated (Spearman’s r = 0.90) and differences could be accounted for by empirical calibration, suggesting that reliable TMB assessment across assays, platforms and centers is achievable."

In humans, the embryos go through two waves of active demethylation after fertilization. Active demethylation plays a key role in many biological process, such as early embryo development, primordial germ cell development and neuron differenciation. It is mediated by ten-eleven translocation protein family (TET) to produce a serial of oxidized derivatives of 5-methylcytosine (5mC), including 5-hydroxylmethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC).

To improve our understanding of underlying biology and therapeutic possibilities in this disease, we performed whole genome sequencing, methylation, and expression analyses of a comprehensive set of 47 ovarian cancer cell lines representing different histologic tumor subtypes. Given the challenges of genomic analyses in tumors without matched normal samples, we developed novel approaches for detection of somatic alterations and used these to identify sequence, copy number, and rearrangement changes and integrated these with genome-wide epigenetic and expression alterations. Ovarian cancer cell lines had molecular changes in genes involved in cell cycle, PI3K, RAS, BRCA, chromatin regulating, and p53 pathways, and displayed global mutation and methylation changes similar to primary ovarian carcinoma. We identified alterations not previously implicated in ovarian cancer including amplification or overexpression of ASXL1 and H3F3B, deletion or underexpression of CDC73 and members of the TGF beta receptor pathway, including TGFBR2, SMAD3 and SMAD4, in-frame rearrangements of YAP1-MAML2 and IKZF2-ERBB4, and fusions involving MET, NF1, FBXW7 and CCND1. Integrating cell line alterations with dose-response data using three targeted therapies revealed novel molecular dependencies, including increased sensitivity of tumors with PIK3CA and PPP2R1A alterations to PI3K inhibitor GNE-493, those with MYC amplifications to PARP inhibitor BMN673, and SMAD4 alterations to MEK inhibitor MEK162. Genome-wide analyses revealed intrachromosomal rearrangements as an improved measure of sensitivity to PARP inhibition compared to the homologous recombination defect (HRD) score.

Gastric cancer (GC) has significant heterogeneity among patients, and novel prognostic markers and therapeutic targets may improve its outcomes. The role of CHAF1A in GC is unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that CHAF1A was overexpressed in GC tissues accompanied by low expression of wild-type P53 and high expression of the proliferation marker MKI67. In vitro, CHAF1A knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest and promoted apoptosis, while CHAF1A overexpression had contrary effects. In vivo, CHAF1A knockdown inhibited tumorigenicity of GC cells. A microarray assay with CHAF1A inhibition and a PathScan signaling antibody array with CHAF1A overexpression showed that CHAF1A inhibited the P53 pathway, activated stress response and induced glycolytic metabolism. In 665 patients, the expression level of CHAF1A protein was an independent predictor for overall survival and disease-free survival in non-cardia GC and also had survival associations in patients with small or perineural invasion-negative tumors. Tumor mRNA analyses based on next-generation sequencing in patients indicated that CHAF1A promoted the Warburg effect by depressing oxidative phosphorylation and increasing glycolysis. Furthermore, the heterogeneous clinical significance of CHAF1A among patient subgroups was associated with its differential regulation of gene expression involved with glycolysis and cell proliferation and survival, indicating that the role of CHAF1A is depended on patient characteristics. These results reveal critical roles and clinical values for CHAF1A in GC. CHAF1A may have context-dependent effects in GC, which increases understandings for GC heterogeneity."

We aimed to describe the genomic mutational landscape of RIMs.Methods:  We analyzed a principal cohort of 18 RIMs, with 31 RIMs overall, from patients who received childhood radiation therapy and 30 SMs, as a comparator population. We performed a multiplatform integrative genomic analysis; including methylation, whole exome and RNA sequencing. Results: RIMs exhibited a five-fold increase in copy number alterations, commonly the loss of chromosome 1p (17/18 RIMs) and 22q (17/18 RIMs), which was significantly more than observed in sporadic meningiomas. Furthermore, RNA sequencing data revealed an NF2 gene fusion event in 35.3% of RIMs. In all 6 cases, there was a complete NF2 exon spliced into a complete exon of a reciprocal gene, suggesting that the breakpoints of genomic rearrangement are intronic. All tumours with the NF2 fusion also possessed monosomy of chromosome 22q, rendering the cells with homozygous disruption of NF2. Clinically, RIMs with the NF2 fusion exhibited ill-defined borders and a tendency to develop in anatomic frontal location. Also, targeted sequencing panel confirmed that RIMs had fewer nonsynonymous NF2 mutations (6.5% vs. 30% in SM) and absence of mutations in TRAF7, SMO, KLF4, PIK3CA and AKT1, genes traditionally involved in SMs.Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that RIMs have distinct genomic drivers of oncogenesis as compared to SMs, specifically NF2 inactivation through fusion event. Radiation therapy possibly triggers genomic structural rearrangements through error-prone repair of double-stranded DNA breaks."
EGAS00001002326, exome sequencing   invasive diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma sampled   sites,"The lateral ventricle subventricular zone (SVZ) is a frequent site of high-grade glioma (HGG) spread and tumor invasion of the SVZ is a predictor of a worse clinical prognosis. A range of HGG types invade the stem cell niche of the SVZ, including both adult glioblastoma and pediatric high-grade gliomas such as diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). The cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating this frequent invasion of the SVZ are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that neural precursor cell (NPC):glioma cell communication underpins the propensity of glioma to colonize the SVZ. SVZ NPCs secrete chemoattractant signals toward which glioma cells home. Biochemical and proteomic analyses of factors secreted by SVZ NPCs revealed a discrete list of candidate proteins. Necessity and sufficiency testing implicated the neurite outgrowth-promoting factor pleiotrophin, along with three required binding partners (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), SPARC-like protein 1, and heat shock protein 90B), as key mediators of this chemoattractant effect. Pleiotrophin protein expression is strongly enriched in the SVZ, and knockdown of pleiotrophin expression starkly reduced glioma invasion of the SVZ in the adult murine brain.  Pleiotrophin, in complex with the three binding partners, activated the Rho/ROCK pathway in DIPG cells, and inhibition of ROCK resulted in decreased DIPG invasion toward SVZ neural precursor cell-secreted factors. These findings demonstrate a pathogenic role for neural precursor cell – glioma interactions and potential therapeutic targets to limit glioma invasion."

EGAS00001002740,targeted gene panel  171 ptcls,"Mature T-cell lymphomas, including peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (NKTL), represent a heterogeneous group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas with dismal outcomes and limited treatment options. To determine the extent of involvement of the JAK/STAT pathway in this malignancy, we performed targeted capture sequencing of 188 genes in this pathway in 171 PTCL and NKTL cases. A total of 272 nonsynonymous somatic mutations in 101 genes were identified in 73% of the samples, including 258 single-nucleotide variants and 14 insertions or deletions. Recurrent mutations were most frequently located in STAT3 and TP53 (15%), followed by JAK3 and JAK1 (6%) and SOCS1 (4%). A high prevalence of STAT3 mutation (21%) was observed specifically in NKTL. Novel STAT3 mutations (p.D427H, E616G, p.E616K, and p.E696K) were shown to increase STAT3 phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of STAT3 in the absence of cytokine, in which p.E616K induced programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression by robust binding of activated STAT3 to the PD-L1 gene promoter. Consistent with these findings, PD-L1 was overexpressed in NKTL cell lines harboring hotspot STAT3 mutations, and similar findings were observed by the overexpression of p.E616K and p.E616G in the STAT3 wild-type NKTL cell line. Conversely, STAT3 silencing and inhibition decreased PD-L1 expression in STAT3 mutant NKTL cell lines. In NKTL tumors, STAT3 activation correlated significantly with PD-L1 expression. We demonstrated that STAT3 activation confers high PD-L1 expression, which may promote tumor immune evasion. The combination of PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies and STAT3 inhibitors might be a promising therapeutic approach for NKTL, and possibly PTCL."

To determine the prevalence and distribution of FOXO1 mutations in pediatric Burkitt lymphoma (BL), we sequenced a large number of sporadic and endemic BL patient samples. We report a high frequency of FOXO1 mutations in both sporadic and endemic BL at diagnosis, occurring in 23/78 (29%) and 48/89 (54%) samples respectively, as well as 8/16 (50%) cases at relapse. Mutations of T24 were the most common in sporadic BL but were rare in endemic cases, in which mutations of residue S22, also within the AKT recognition motif, were the most frequent. FOXO1 mutations were almost always present in the major tumor cell clone but were not associated with outcome. Analysis of other recurrent mutations reported in BL revealed that FOXO1 mutations were associated with mutations of DDX3X and ARID1A, but not MYC, TCF3/ID3 or members of the phosphatidylinositol 3’ OH kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. We further show common nuclear retention of the FOXO1 protein, irrespective of mutation status, suggesting alternative unknown mechanisms for maintaining FOXO1 transcriptional activity in BL. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of FOXO1 in an endemic cell line produced a significant decrease in cell proliferation, supporting an oncogenic role for FOXO1 in endemic BL. Thus, FOXO1 is frequently mutated in both sporadic and endemic BL and may offer a potential therapeutic target for pediatric BL patients worldwide."

We combined blood tests for KRAS gene mutations with carefully thresholded protein biomarkers to determine whether the combination of these markers was superior to any single marker.  The cohort tested included 221 patients with resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and 185 control patients without known cancers.  KRAS mutations were detected in the plasma of 66 patients (30%) and every mutation found in the plasma was identical to that subsequently found in the patients' primary tumor (100% concordance).  The use of KRAS in conjunction with two thresholded protein biomarkers (CA19-9 and prolactin) increased the sensitivity to 67%.  Only one of the 185 plasma samples from the control cohort were positive for any of the three markers (99.5% specificity).  This combinatorial approach may prove useful for the earlier detection of many cancer types."

EGAS00001003422,synthetic rna modulators  gene function  pilot study,"While the scale of GWAS, and number of discovered loci associated with traits has substantially increased over the past decade, functional validation, and understanding of underlying biology driving these associations has lagged behind; limiting translation of these discoveries into therapeutic applications. In this context, synthetic RNA modulators of gene function provide an efficient, and high-throughput mechanism for validation of discoveries in cellular models, providing a platform for interrogation and translation of findings from GWAS, into therapeutic applications within an integrated platform. An improvement in our understanding of the regulation of gene functions by different types of RNA modulators, and the technological development in the field of synthetic RNA molecules, has enabled high-throughput functional assays of cellular phenotypes in multiple cellular models, as well as opportunities to translate these discoveries directly into therapeutics. Complementary to this, recent development of deep learning approaches to effectively predict miRNA-target associations (Rayner et al., 2017) and promoter regions have provided a rich database of computationally predicted modulators of gene function for functional validation. We propose a high-throughput screen of 380 synthetic RNA molecules across 15 genes identified as associated with cardiometabolic and other traits through multiple lines of evidence (GWAS, eQTL, functional studies, and/or mouse phenotyping). We will use a range of synthetic RNA molecules to target a set of genes of interest in cellular models (HepG2 cell lines), to examine changes in target gene expression (efficacy), immunogenicity and cell-viability. Promoters will be identified through existing databases, and deep learning and bioinformatics approaches; we will also use predicted miRNA-target associations identified through deep learning frameworks trained on experimental evidence (Rayner et al., 2017), as part of an established collaboration. Alongside integrated genetic and EHR data, such datasets provide the opportunity to align multidimensional data to understand loci associated with disease, and identify potential therapeutic targets.

EGAS00001003737, targeted gene panel  covers coding noncoding  short tandem repeat regions improves  diagnosis  patients  neurodegenerative diseases,"Genetic testing for diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) is highly challenging because of genotype heterogeneity and overlapping clinical manifestations. Targeted-gene panels (TGPs), coupled with next-generation sequencing (NGS), can facilitate the profiling of a large repertoire of ND-related genes and help with differential diagnosis. Due to the technical limitations inherent in NGS and TGPs, short tandem repeat (STR) variations are often ignored. However, STR expansions are known to cause such NDs as Huntington’s disease and several types of spinocerebellar ataxias, such as SCA type 3 (SCA3).Here, we studied the clinical utility of a custom-made TGP that targets 199 NDs and 311 ND-associated genes on 118 undiagnosed patients. At least one known pathogenic or likely pathogenic variation was found in 54 (45.8%) patients; 27 (22.9%) of the 118 patients demonstrated clinical profiles that matched the variants. Based on the findings from the TGP, we refined the original diagnosis of 16 patients. A high concordance of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (99.9%) and small insertions and deletions (93.2%) were observed when comparing the results from TGP and whole-exome sequencing of four patients. We tested an in-house STR detection algorithm, and it reached a specificity of 0.88 and a sensitivity of 0.82 in our SCA3 cohort. This study also uncovered a trove of novel and recurrent variants that may enrich the repertoire of ND-related genetic markers. We propose that a combination of comprehensive TGPs and the bioinformatics analysis pipeline can improve the clinical diagnosis and accelerate the diagnosis of NDs."

Analysis of mutations in cell free (cf) DNA offers a non-invasive approach to detect mutations that may be prognostic for disease survival or predictive for primary or secondary drug resistance. A main challenge for the application of cfDNA as a diagnostic tool is the diverse mutational landscape of cancer. Here, we developed a flexible end-to-end experimental and bioinformatics workflow to analyze mutations in cfDNA using custom amplicon sequencing. Our approach relies on open software tools to select primers suitable for multiplex PCR using minimal cfDNA as input. In addition, we developed a robust linear model to identify specific genetic alterations from sequencing data of cfDNA. We used our method to design a custom amplicon panel suitable for detection of hotspot mutations relevant for colorectal cancer and analyzed mutations in serial cfDNA samples from 34 patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Our data demonstrates that recurrent and patient-specific mutational patterns can be reliably detected for the majority of patients. Furthermore, we show that the allele frequency of mutations in cfDNA correlates well with disease progression. Finally, we demonstrate that monitoring of cfDNA can outperform the predictive power of currently used tumor markers and reveal mechanisms of resistance to anti-EGFR antibody treatment."

OC organoids recapitulate histological and genomic features of the pertinent lesion from which they were derived, illustrating intra- and inter-patient heterogeneity, and can be genetically modified.  We show that OC organoids can be used for drug screening assays and capture different tumor subtype responses to the gold standard platinum-based chemotherapy, including acquisition of chemoresistance in recurrent disease. Finally, OC organoids can be xenografted, enabling in vivo drug sensitivity assays. Taken together, this demonstrates their potential application for research and personalized medicine."

Objective:The objective of this study was to determine molecular alterations and mediating resistant mechanisms and to suggest additional treatment options.Design, Setting, and Participants:Four patients were enrolled into the MORE (Molecular Renal Cancer Evolution) trial. We investigated the mutational spectra of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) at baseline and compared them to those upon clonal evolution at progression on systemic therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.Outcome Measurements:DNA was isolated from tumor tissues after surgery, metastasis biopsies after progression on sunitinib or axitinib, and subjected to whole-exome sequencing (WES). In addition, the exomes of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from two patients were sequenced at baseline and at progression.Results and Limitations:Our data provide evidence for clonal evolution and various acquired resistance mechanisms of ccRCC with subclonal mutations in FLT4, MTOR, ITGA3/5, SETD2, and VHL on metastatic progression. The limited number of shared mutations in tissue and plasma biopsies indicates that both sources provide complementary information, possibly due to mutations present in metastatic lesions which were not amenable to tissue sampling but are represented in the ctDNA. Conclusion:Acquired resistance to targeted therapies in metastatic ccRCC is due to intra-tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution. Larger patient cohorts have to be studied to estimate the benefit of WES from biopsies and ctDNA for therapy decision in metastatic ccRCC.Patient Summary:We analyzed the molecular profiles of ccRCC patients in primary tissues and metastatic tissues upon progression on tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.

Neighbouring glioma cells maintain extreme degrees of genetic and phenotypic variation that forms intratumoural heterogeneity. This genetic diversity allows the most adaptive tumour clones to show treatment resistance and conserve the tumour bulk. We aimed to model this phenomenon and  test  the  effectiveness  of  several  targeted  therapeutic  interventions  to  overcome  therapy resistance. Heterogenic tumour masses were first deconstructed into single tumour cells, which were  expanded  independently  as  single-cell  clones.  SNP  arrays,  whole-genome  and  RNA sequencing, and CpG methylation analysis validated the unique molecular profile of each tumour clone, which displayed distinct pathologic features, including cell morphology, growth rate, and resistance to temozolomide and ionizing radiation. We also identified variable sensitivities to AURK, CDK, and EGFR inhibitors, consistent with the heterogenic molecular alterations that each clone  harboured.  These  targeted  therapies  effectively  eliminated  the  temozolomide-  and/or irradiation-resistant clones and also parental polyclonal cells. Our findings indicate that polyclonal tumours create a dynamic environment that consists of diverse tumour elements and treatment responses. Designing targeted therapies based on a range of molecular profiles can be a more effective strategy to eradicate treatment resistance, recurrence, and metastasis."

These experiments are accompanied by RNA seq analysis.
To this end, we conducted the following: H9 cells were synchronized in G2/M and then differentiated into endoderm for 24h, in presence or absence of different agents capable of blocking cells in specific phases of the cell cycle (Hydroxyurea: S-phase; Nocodazole: G2/M phase). Cells were collected at different time points. 12h after differentiation: Majority of the cells should be in S phase. In presence of Hidroxyurea (HU), cells should not live S phase and therefore, by the end of the experiment (24h-HU) those cells should still be in S phase; Nocodazole (Noc) was added after 12h of differentiation with the goal of blocking cells in the first G2/M phase during differentiation. Majority of these cells should be in G2/M by the end of the experiment (24h-Noc).

To investigate their effect on synaptic connectivity, we generated cortical neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from neurotypic and ASD-affected donors. We developed Sparse coculture for Connectivity (SparCon) assays where SHANK2 and control neurons were differentially labeled and sparsely seeded together on a lawn of unlabeled control neurons. We observed striking increases in dendrite length, dendrite complexity, total synapse number, and frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents. These findings were phenocopied in gene-edited homozygous SHANK2 knockout cells and rescued by gene correction of an ASD SHANK2 muation, supporting a role for SHANK2 as a regulator of connectivity in developing human neurons. Dendrite length increases were exacerbated by IGF1, TG003, or BDNF, and suppressed by DHPG treatment. The transcriptome in these isogenic SHANK2 neurons was deeply perturbed in synapse, plasticity, and neuronal morphogenesis gene sets and ASD gene modules, and activity-dependent dendrite extension was impaired. Our unexpected findings provide evidence for hyperconnectivity and profoundly altered transcriptome in SHANK2 neurons derived from ASD subjects."
EGAS00001003257,mycn amplification  atrx mutations  incompatible  neuroblastoma,"Age and stage of disease at diagnosis is associated with outcome in neuroblastoma. A previous study identified ATRX point mutations and in-frame deletions in older patients with stage 4 disease. To validate the frequency of ATRX mutations and assess the relation of mutations and known prognostic variables, we collaborated with the Children’s Oncology Group and sequenced the entire ATRX genomic locus in 475 neuroblastoma tumor samples to validate the frequency of ATRX mutations and assess the relation of mutations and known prognostic variables.  Older age at diagnosis, stage 4 disease, and unfavorable histology were significantly associated with mutations in the ATRX gene; MYCN amplification was mutually exclusive from ATRX mutations. To directly test if ATRX mutations and MYCN amplification are incompatible in neuroblastoma, we mutated the ATRX gene in MYCN amplified neuroblastoma cell lines and ectopically expressed MYCN in ATRX mutant neuroblastoma cell lines. Both approaches showed that ATRX and MYCN amplification are incompatible in neuroblastoma in culture and in vivo. To gain a better understanding of the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of this incompatibility, we performed a series of experiments including telomere analysis, epigenetic profiling, electron microscopic analysis and metabolic profiling. We discovered that induction of MYCN expression in ATRX mutant neuroblastomas cells leads to metabolic reprogramming, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species and replicative stress. We propose that this leads to synthetic lethality in ATRX mutant neuroblastomas because of the underlying replicative stress in those cells as a result of dysfunction of this essential histone chaperone."

Using synthetic and published single-cell CpG datasets we show that Epiclomal outperforms non-probabilistic methods and is able to handle the inherent missing data feature which dominates single-cell CpG genome sequences. Using a recently published single-cell 5mCpG sequencing method (PBAL), we show that Epiclomal discovers sub-clonal patterns of methylation in aneuploid tumour genomes, thus defining epiclones.

Molecular characterization of this cancer remains limited. We present a case of an adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) in a 37-yr-old female, with dual lung metastases identified 1 yr following commencement of adjuvant mitotane therapy. As standard therapeutic regimens are often unsuccessful in ACC, we undertook a comprehensive genomic study into this case to identify treatment options and monitor disease progress. We performed targeted and whole-genome sequencing of germline, primary tumor, and both metastatic tumors from this patient and monitored recurrence over 2 yr using liquid biopsy for ctDNA and steroid hormone measurements. Sequencing revealed the primary and metastatic tumors were hyperhaploid, with extensive loss of heterozygosity but few structural rearrangements. Loss-of-function mutations were identified in MSH2, TP53, RB1, and PTEN, resulting in tumors with mismatch repair signatures and microsatellite instability. At the cellular level, tumors were populated by mitochondria-rich oncocytes. Longitudinal ctDNA mutation and hormone profiles were unable to detect micrometastatic disease, consistent with clinical indicators of disease remission. The molecular signatures in our ACC case suggested immunotherapy in the event of disease progression; however, the patient remains free of cancer. The extensive molecular analysis presented here could be applied to other rare and/or poorly stratified cancers, to identify novel or repurpose existing therapeutic options, thereby broadly improving diagnoses, treatments, and prognoses."

However, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of errors introduced at various steps of a conventional NGS workflow, such as sample handling, library preparation, PCR enrichment, and sequencing. In this study, we use current NGS technology to systematically investigate these questions.ResultsBy evaluating read-specific error distributions, we discover that the substitution error rate can be computationally suppressed to 10-5 to 10-4, which is 10- to 100-fold lower than generally considered achievable (10-3) in the current literature. We then quantify substitution errors attributable to sample handling, library preparation, enrichment PCR, and sequencing by using multiple deep sequencing datasets. We find that error rates differ by nucleotide substitution types, ranging from 10-5 for A&gt;C/T&gt;G, C&gt;A/G&gt;T, and C&gt;G/G&gt;C changes to 10-4 for A&gt;G/T&gt;C changes. Furthermore, C&gt;T/G&gt;A errors exhibit strong sequence context dependency, sample-specific effects dominate elevated C&gt;A/G&gt;T errors, and target enrichment PCR led to aprox 6-fold increase of overall error rate. We also find that more than 70% of hotspot variants can be detected at 0.1% - 0.01% frequency with the current NGS technology by applying in-silico error suppression.ConclusionsWe present the first comprehensive analysis of sequencing error sources in conventional NGS workflows. The error profiles revealed by our study highlight new directions for further improving NGS analysis accuracy both experimentally and computationally, ultimately enhancing the precision of deep sequencing."

Here, studying clonal evolution of tumor cells derived from human pancreatic tumors, we demonstrate that in vitro cultures and in vivo tumors are maintained by a common set of tumorigenic cells that can be used to establish clonal replica tumors (CRTs), large cohorts of animals bearing human tumors with identical clonal composition. Using CRTs to conduct quantitative assessments of adaptive responses to therapeutics, we uncovered a multitude of functionally heterogeneous subpopulations of cells with differential degrees of drug sensitivity. High-throughput isolation and deep characterization of unique clonal lineages showed genetic and transcriptomic diversity underlying functionally diverse subpopulations. Molecular annotation of gemcitabine-naïve clonal lineages with distinct responses to treatment in the context of CRTs generated signatures that can predict the response to chemotherapy, representing a potential biomarker to stratify patients with pancreatic cancer.

However, the impact of different modes of subsistence on recent changes in population size, patterns of gene flow, and deleterious mutational load remains unclear. Here, we report high-coverage exomes from various populations of rainforest hunter-gatherers and farmers from central Africa. We find that the recent demographic histories of hunter-gatherers and farmers differed considerably, with population collapses for hunter-gatherers and expansions for farmers, accompanied by increased gene flow. We show that purifying selection against newly arising deleterious alleles is of similar efficiency across African populations, in contrast with Europeans where we detect weaker purifying selection. Furthermore, the per-individual mutation load of rainforest hunter-gatherers is similar to that of farmers, under both additive and recessive models. Our results indicate that differences in the cultural practices and demographic regimes of African populations have not resulted in large differences in mutational burden, and highlight the beneficial role of gene flow in reshaping the distribution of deleterious genetic variation across human populations."

Here we analyzed 250 BCP-ALL cases and identified a novel subgroup (‘PAX5-plus’, n=19) by distinct DNA methylation and gene expression profiles. All patients in this subgroup harbored mutations in the B-lineage transcription factor PAX5, with p.P80R as hotspot. Mutations either affected two independent codons, consistent with compound heterozygosity, or suffered LOH predominantly through chromosome 9p aberrations. These biallelic events resulted in disruption of PAX5 transcriptional programs regulating B cell differentiation and tumor suppressor functions. Homozygous CDKN2A/B deletions and RAS activating hotspot mutations were highly enriched as cooperating events in the genomic profile of PAX5-plus ALL. Together this defined a specific pattern of triple alterations, exclusive to the novel subgroup. PAX5-plus ALL was observed in pediatric and adult patients. Although restricted by the limited sample size, a tendency for more favorable clinical outcome was observed with 10 of 12 adult PAX5-plus patients achieving long-term survival. PAX5-plus represents the first BCP-ALL subgroup defined by sequence alterations in contrast to gross chromosomal events and exemplifies how deregulated differentiation (PAX5), impaired cell cycle control (CDKN2A/B) together with sustained proliferative signaling (RAS) cooperatively drives leukemogenesis."

Recently, de novo KMT2A variants have been identified in sequencing studies of cohorts of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). However, most of these studies lack the detailed clinical information required to determine whether those individuals have isolated NDDs or WSS (i.e. syndromic NDDs). We performed thorough clinical and neurodevelopmental phenotyping on six individuals with de novo KMT2A variants. From these data, we found that all six patients met clinical criteria for WSS and we further define the neurodevelopmental phenotypes associated with KMT2A variants and WSS. In particular, we identified a subtype of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in five individuals, characterized by marked rigid, repetitive and inflexible behaviours, emotional dysregulation, externalizing behaviours, but relative social motivation. To further explore the clinical spectrum associated with KMT2A variants, we also conducted a meta-analysis of individuals with KMT2A variants reported in the published literature. We found that de novo LoF or missense variants in KMT2A were significantly more prevalent than predicted by a previously established statistical model of de novo mutation rate for KMT2A. Our genotype-phenotype findings better define the clinical spectrum associated with KMT2A variants and suggest that individuals with de novo LoF and missense variants likely have a clinically unrecognized diagnosis of WSS, rather than isolated NDD or ASD alone. This highlights the importance of a clinical genetic and neurodevelopmental assessment for individuals with such variants in KMT2A."

The estimated incidence and prevalence for CMD is 4.65/100,000 and 0.68/100,000 respectively, although these are probably an underestimate. Patients present at birth or within the first few months of life with hypotonia and muscle weakness. Other features include eye and brain abnormalities, joint contractures, respiratory and cardiac involvement and skin changes. The majority are severely progressive and there is no treatment available. There are 24 known causative genes (LAMA2, COL6A1, COL6A2, COL6A3, COL12A1, ITGA7, ITGA9, SEPN1, LMNA, CHKB, POMT1, POMT2, POMGNT1, FKTN, FKRP, LARGE, DPM3, DPM2, DAG1, DOLK, ISPD, B3GNT1, B3GALNT2, GMPPB) . Except for collagen genes and LMNA, in most cases mutations are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Several of these genes have been identified very recently by Whole-Exome-Sequencing (for example COL12A1, B3GALNT2 and GMPPB) demonstrating the suitability of this technique in the field of muscular dystrophies. However, there are patients in whom all known genetic forms have been excluded which are clinically and pathologically undistinguishable from genetically defined forms. A recent study of the UK population indicates that collagen VI defects are the most common subgroup (which is also our experience in the Spanish population).  However, in that same study a genetic diagnosis could not be reached in 50% of CMD cases after testing of all genes. Diagnosis is based on clinical assessment and analysis of muscle biopsy or fibroblast cultures using antibodies that recognise the primary or secondary defective proteins such as collagen VI, α-dystroglycan and laminin-α2, although these are not always conclusive and there is overlap between different forms (for example in the dystroglycanopathies). Brain and muscle magnetic resonance imaging can also help towards diagnosis. A combination of these techniques is used to guide gene sequencing which is often done one a gene by gene basis or sometimes using panels for a selection of genes.

EGAS00001002213, day genomic  epigenomic diagnosis  brain tumors  realtime nanopore sequencing,"Molecular classification of cancer has entered clinical routine to inform diagnosis, prognosis and treatment decisions. At the same time, new tumor entities have been identified that cannot be defined histologically. For central nervous systems tumors, the current World Health Organization classification explicitly demands molecular testing, e.g. for 1p/19q- codeletion or IDH mutations, to make an integrated histomolecular diagnosis. However, a plethora of sophisticated technologies is currently needed to assess different genomic and epigenomic alterations and turnaround times are in the range of weeks, which makes standardized and widespread implementation difficult and hinders timely decision making. Here, we explored the potential of a pocket-size nanopore sequencing device for multimodal and rapid molecular diagnostics of cancer. Low-pass whole genome sequencing was used to simultaneously generate copy number (CN) and methylation profiles from native tumor DNA in the same sequencing run. Single nucleotide variants in IDH1, IDH2, TP53, H3F3A and the TERT promoter region were identified using deep amplicon sequencing. Nanopore sequencing yielded ~0.1X genome coverage within six hours and resulting CN and epigenetic profiles correlated well with matched microarray data. Diagnostically relevant alterations, such as 1p/19q codeletion, and focal amplifications could be recapitulated. Using ad hoc random forests, we could perform supervised pan-cancer classification to distinguish gliomas, medulloblastomas and brain metastases of different primary sites. Single nucleotide variants in IDH1, IDH2 and H3F3A were identified using deep amplicon sequencing within minutes of sequencing. Detection of TP53 and TERT promoter mutations shows that sequencing of entire genes and GC-rich regions is feasible. Nanopore sequencing allows same-day detection of structural variants, point mutations and methylation profiling using a single device with negligible capital cost. It outperforms hybridization-based and current sequencing technologies with respect to time-to diagnosis and required laboratory equipment and expertise, aiming to make precision medicine possible for every cancer patient, even in resource restricted settings."

A combination of untargeted and targeted sequencing methods, applied to two independent cohorts of patients (n=90) with various renal tumour subtypes, were used to determine ctDNA content in plasma and urine. Our data revealed lower plasma ctDNA levels in RCC relative to other cancers, with untargeted detection of ~33% for both cohorts. A highly sensitive personalised approach, applied to plasma and urine from select patients (n=22), improved detection to ~50%, including in patients with early stage and even benign lesions. A machine-learning based model, applied to untargeted data, predicted this detection, potentially offering a means of triaging patient samples for personalised analysis. We observed that plasma, and for the first time, urine ctDNA may better represent tumour heterogeneity than a single tissue biopsy. Longitudinal sampling of &gt;200 plasma samples revealed that ctDNA can track disease course. These data highlight low ctDNA levels in RCC but indicate potential clinical utility provided improvement in isolation and detection approaches."

In the first stage of this adaptive, non-comparative phase II trial (TONIC-trial; NCT02499367), 67 patients with metastatic TNBC were randomized to nivolumab without induction or to one of four induction treatments, consisting of irradiation of one metastatic lesion (3x8 Gy) or a two- week low-dose regimen of cyclophosphamide, cisplatin or doxorubicin, all followed by nivolumab. In the overall cohort of 66 evaluable patients, the objective response rate (ORR; iRECIST16) was 20% (95% CI: 11%-31%), with two complete responses and 11 partial responses. The majority of clinical responses were observed on nivolumab in the cisplatin (ORR 23%; 3/13) and doxorubicin (ORR 35%; 6/17) cohorts. After doxorubicin and cisplatin induction, we detected an upregulation of immune-related genes, involved in PD-1/PD-L1, and T-cell cytotoxicity pathways. This was further supported by enrichment among upregulated genes related to inflammation, JAK-STAT and TNFα-signaling after doxorubicin. In addition, we observed a trend towards increased T-cell infiltration, measured using T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, after doxorubicin. Together, the clinical and translational data of this study testing different immune induction strategies prior to nivolumab suggest that short-term doxorubicin and cisplatin may induce a more favorable TME and increase the likelihood of response to PD-1 blockade in TNBC. These data warrant further confirmation in TNBC and exploration of induction treatments prior to PD-1 blockade in other cancer types."

Most recently, we identified an 8 amino acid insertion in the cytoplasmic tail of HLA-DQβ1 as strong achalasia risk factor in a sample set from Central Europe, Italy, and Spain. Here, we tested whether the HLA-DQβ1 insertion also confers achalasia risk in the Polish and Swedish population. We could replicate the initial findings and the insertion shows strong achalasia association in both samples (Poland P = 1.84×10-04, Sweden P = 7.44×10-05). Combining all five European data sets – Central Europe, Italy, Spain, Poland, and Sweden – the insertion is achalasia associated with Pcombined = 1.67×10-35. In addition, we observe that the frequency of the insertion shows a geospatial north-south gradient. The insertion is less common in northern (around 6-7% in patients and 2% in controls from Sweden and Poland) compared to southern Europeans (around 16% in patients and 8% in controls from Italy) and shows a stronger attributable risk (AR) in the southern European population. Our study provides evidence that the prevalence of achalasia may differ between populations."

In this pilot we will assess the feasibility of the approach in the relevant tissue. We will obtain diseased and non-diseased tissue (cartilage and endochondral bone) following TJR, coupled with a blood sample, from 12 patients. We will generate genotype data on the HumanCoreExome array and will characterise the 12 pairs of diseased and non-diseased tissue samples in terms of methylation (Illumina 450k array), transcription (RNASeq) and expression (quantitative proteomics). The pilot will help assess the feasibility of isolating sufficient levels of starting material for the different approaches, and will instigate the development of analytical approaches to synthesising the resulting data. If successful, it is envisaged that we will proceed with expanding the work to 500 patients in the first year, with a target total sample size of 3,000 in the longer term.

In this study, we delineate the fusion gene landscape in a consecutive series of 195 pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP ALL). Using RNA-sequencing, we find in-frame fusion genes in 127 (65%) cases, including 27 novel fusions. We describe a new subtype characterized by recurrent IGH-DUX4 or ERG-DUX4 fusions, representing 4% of cases, leading to overexpression of DUX4 and frequently co-occurring with intragenic ERG deletions. Furthermore, we identify a subtype characterized by an ETV6-RUNX1-like gene expression profile and coexisting ETV6 and IKZF1 alterations.

We report a living biobank of PDOs from metastatic, heavily-pretreated colorectal and gastroesophageal cancer patients recruited in phase I/II clinical trials.  Phenotypic and genotypic profiling of PDOs showed a high-degree of similarity to the original patient tumor.  Molecular profiling of tumor organoids was matched to drug screening results, suggesting PDOs could complement existing approaches in defining cancer vulnerabilities and improving treatment responses. We compared ex vivo organoid responses to anticancer agents, and PDO-based orthotopic mouse tumor xenograft models to the response of the patient in clinical trials.  Our data suggest that PDOs can recapitulate patient responses in the clinic, and have the potential to be implemented in personalized medicine programs."

EGAS00001002704,dynamics  neoantigen landscape  immunotherapy,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown significant therapeutic responses against tumors containing increased mutation-associated neoantigen load. We have examined the evolving landscape of tumor neoantigens during the emergence of acquired resistance in non-small cell lung cancer patients after initial response to immune checkpoint blockade with anti-PD1 or anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA4 antibodies. Analyses of matched pretreatment and resistant tumors identified genomic changes resulting in loss of 7 to 18 putative mutation-associated neoantigens in resistant clones. Peptides generated from the eliminated neoantigens elicited clonal T cell expansion in autologous T cell cultures, suggesting that they generated functional immune responses. Neoantigen loss occurred through elimination of tumor subclones or through deletion of chromosomal regions containing truncal alterations and were associated with changes in T cell receptor clonality. These analyses provide insights into the dynamics of mutational landscapes during immune checkpoint blockade and have implications for development of immune therapies that target tumor neoantigens."

This catastrophic genomic event, involved in tumorigenesis, is characterized by tens to hundreds of simultaneously acquired locally clustered rearrangements on one chromosome. We hypothesized that leukemias developing in individuals with Ataxia Telangiectasia, who are born with two mutated copies of the ATM gene, an essential guardian of genome stability, would show a higher prevalence of chromothripsis due to the associated defect in DNA double-strand break repair. Using whole-genome sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization and RNA sequencing, we characterized the genomic landscape of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) arising in patients with Ataxia Telangiectasia. We detected a high frequency of chromothriptic events in these tumors, specifically on acrocentric chromosomes, as compared to tumors from individuals with other types of DNA repair syndromes (27 cases total, 10 with Ataxia Telangiectasia). Our data suggest that the genomic landscape of Ataxia Telangiectasia ALL is clearly distinct from that of sporadic ALL. Mechanistically, short telomeres and compromised DNA damage response in cells of Ataxia Telangiectasia patients may be linked with frequent chromothripsis. Furthermore, we show that ATM loss is associated with increased chromothripsis prevalence in additional tumor entities."

We compared diagnostic rate of WGS to CMA and targeted gene testing of 100 patients referred to The Hospital for Sick Children Genetics clinic in 2014. WGS identified genetic variants meeting clinical diagnostic criteria in 34% of cases, representing a 4-fold increase in diagnostic rate over CMA (8%) (p-value = 1.42e-05) alone and &gt;2-fold increase in CMA plus targeted gene sequencing (13%) (p-value = 0.0009). WGS identified all rare clinically significant CNVs that were detected by CMA. In an additional 26 patients, WGS revealed indel and missense mutations presenting in a dominant (63%) or a recessive (37%) manner.

EGAS00001002683,comprehensive molecular portraits  male breast cancer,"Purpose: Male breast cancer is extremely rare and accounts for less than 1% of all breast malignancies. Therefore, clinical management of breast cancer in males is currently guided by research on the disease in females, despite possible differences in pathogenesis, biology and genetics.Experimental Design: A discovery cohort of 45 male breast cancers (FFPE-derived) and a validation cohort of 90 MBC (52 FFPE and 38 FF-derived) were subjected to massively parallel sequencing targeting all exons of 1943 cancer-related genes. The landscape of somatic mutations, germline mutations and copy number alterations was compared to that of subtype-matched female breast cancers (smFBC) and correlated to prognosis.Results: Within the combined discovery and validation cohort, 90% of MBCs showed ductal histology, 96% were estrogen receptor positive, 66% were progesterone receptor positive, and 2% HER2-positive, resulting in 50%, 46% and 4% luminal A-like, luminal B-like and basal-like cases, respectively. The MBC cohort included 5 patients with Klinefelter syndrome (KS; 4%). The discovery set included none and 5 (11%) patients with pathogenic germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively.The genomic landscape of MBC to some extent recapitulated the smFBC landscape, with recurrent PIK3CA (31%) and GATA3 (9%) mutations, and with 40% of the most frequently amplified genes overlapping between both sexes. TP53 (2%) somatic mutations were significantly less frequent in MBC compared to smFBC whereas KMT2C (38%), HER2 (20%), NCOR1 (16%), TBL1XR1 (13%), BRCA1 (9%) and BRCA2 (9%) somatic mutations were more frequent. Overall, genes regulating chromatin function and DNA damage response seemed more often affected in MBC. High mutational load, but not copy number variation load, independently correlated with poor survival (p=0.021). MDM2 amplifications were frequent (11%), correlated with protein overexpression (p=0.001) and poor survival (p=0.007), and might thus represent an alternative mechanism for p53 inactivation in MBC. In addition, PAK1 (p=0.023), ASH1L (p=0.001) and E2F7 (p=0.009) independently predicted poor survival in MBC when amplified.The majority of BRCA2 germline mutation carriers presented with poorly differentiated tumors, with a high 8q amplification load. In contrast to BRCA2 germline mutation carriers presenting at a similar age as non-mutation carriers, subjects with KS tended to be younger at presentation, with generally well-differentiated, PR positive, and copy number and mutation naive tumors.Conclusion: Despite similarities in the genomic landscape between MBC and FBC, it is becoming increasingly clear that MBC is a molecularly unique disease requiring its own clinical trials (e.g. MDM2 inhibitors) and treatment guidelines. The molecular analysis of MBCs that we report here significantly extends our knowledge base to produce a comprehensive catalogue of likely genomic drivers, therapeutic targets, and putative prognostic and predictive markers for this rare disease."

EGAS00001000074,screening  human epigenetic variation  cpg islands,"Many human characteristics, including susceptibility to disease, are determined genetically. An unexplored alternative to such genetic determination concerns epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation. CpG islands (CGIs) are generally constitutively hypomethylated, however there are circumstances in which they become heavily methylated and, when coincident with a gene promoter, this invariably causes transcriptional silencing. CGI methylation occurs in normal tissues during processes such as X-inactivation, but abnormal patterns of methylation have also been implicated in disease. The vast majority of evidence relates to cancer, where silencing of multiple genes in this way appears to be a causal contributor to the cancer state.

EGAS00001002744, molecular basis  t pll   actionable perturbation  tcl1 atm  epigenetically instructed damage responses,"T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a rare and poor-prognostic mature T-cell malignancy. To address its incomplete molecular concept, we integrated large-scale profiling data of alterations in gene expression, allelic copy number (CN), and nucleotide sequences in 111 well-characterized patients. Besides prominent signatures of T-cell activation and prevalent clonal variants, we also identified novel hot-spots for CN variability, fusion molecules, alternative transcripts, and progression-associated dynamics. The overall lesional spectrum of T-PLL is mainly annotated to axes of DNA damage responses, T-cell receptor/cytokine signaling, and histone modulation. We formulate a multi-dimensional model of T-PLL pathogenesis centered around a unique combination of TCL1 overexpression with damaging ATM aberrations as initiating core lesions. The effects imposed by TCL1 cooperate with compromised ATM towards a leukemogenic phenotype of impaired DNA damage processing. Dysfunctional ATM appears inefficient in alleviating elevated redox burdens and telomere attrition and in evoking a p53-dependent apoptotic response to genotoxic insults. As non-genotoxic strategies, synergistic combinations of p53 reactivators and deacetylase inhibitors reinstate such cell death execution."

EGAS00001002753,defective t cell expansion  rasgrp1 deficiency,"Inherited CTPS1- CD27- and CD70-deficiencies in humans have revealed key factors of T-lymphocyte expansion, that is a prerequisite for an efficient immunity to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. RASGRP1 is a T-lymphocyte specific nucleotide exchange factor known to activate the MAP kinases pathway. A deleterious homozygous mutation in RASGRP1 leading to the loss RASGRP1 expression was identified in two siblings who both developed a persistent EBV infection leading to Hodgkin lymphoma. RASGRP1-deficient T cells exhibited defective MAPK activation and impaired proliferation that was restored by expression of wild-type RASGRP1. Similar defects were observed in T cells from healthy individuals when RASGRP1 was downregulated. RASGRP1-deficient T cells also exhibited decreased CD27-dependent proliferation toward CD70-expressing EBV-transformed B cells, a crucial pathway required for expansion of antigen-specific T cells in anti-EBV immunity. Furthermore, RASGRP1-deficient T cells failed to upregulate CTPS1, an important enzyme required for DNA synthesis. These results show that RASGRP1 deficiency leads to susceptibility to EBV infection, and demonstrate the key role of RASGRP1 at the crossroad of pathways required for the expansion of activated T lymphocytes."

EGAS00001000858,integrative genome profiling  aml,"AML emerges as a consequence of accumulating independent genetic aberrations that direct regulation and/or dysfunction of genes resulting in aberrant activation of signalling pathways, resistance to apoptosis and uncontrolled proliferation. Given the significant heterogeneity of AML genomes, AML patients demonstrate a highly variable response rate and poor median survival in response to current chemotherapy regimens. For the past 4 years we have conducted gene expression profiling on purified bone marrow populations equating to normal haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from healthy subjects and patients with de novo AML in order to identify AML signatures of aberrantly expressed genes in cancer versus normal. We are now applying a series of bioinformatic methodologies combined with clinical and conventional diagnostic data to establish novel genomics strategies for improved prognostication of AML. Additionally, we use our AML signatures to unravel oncogenic signalling pathway activities in AML patients and test inhibitory drugs for these pathways inn preclinical therapeutic programmes. We consider that superimposing GEP and clinical data for our AML patient cohort with additional data on their mutational status will significantly improve the prognostic power of the study as well as unravel yet unknown mutations associated with aberrant signalling activities of oncogenic pathways."

In addition to single variant tests we incorporated information on the predicted functional consequences of PAVs and analysed sets of genes with a higher likelihood of having a role in glioma on the basis of the profile of somatic mutations documented by large-scale sequencing initiatives. Globally tThere was a strong relationship between effect size and SNPs predicted to be damaging (P=2.29x10-49); however, these variants which are most likely to impact on risk, are rare (MAF&lt;5%). While no single variant showed an association which was statistically significant at the genomewide threshold a number of represented promising Notable associations - were seen with the BRCA2:c.9976A&gt;T, p.(Lys3326Ter)BRCA2 p.Lys332X variant,  which has been shown documented to influence breast and lung cancer risks (OR=2.3, P=4.00x10-4 for glioblastoma [GBM]) and IDH2:c.782G&gt;A, p.(Arg261His)IDH2 p.Arg261His (OR=3.21, P=7.67x10-3, for non-GBM). Additionally, gene burden tests revealed a statistically significant association for HARS2 and risk of GBM (P=2.20x10-6).

We compared the gene expression levels between IVL and normal uterine muscle, and between UM and normal uterine muscle, to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We then used Gene Ontology enrichment analysis to determine the functions of the DEGs and perform specimen cluster analysis.We obtained 98 DEGs between IVL and adjacent normal uterine muscle, and 61 DEGs between UM and adjacent normal uterine muscle. Functional enrichment of both IVL and UM DEGs showed their associations with hormone stimulus, extracellular matrix, and cell adhesion. Unsupervised clustering analysis showed that IVL and UM could not be separated completely. Among these dysregulated genes, we found that HOXA13 showed a distinct dysregulated status between IVL and UM. HOXA13 may therefore serve as a biomarker to distinguish IVL and UM. Our results show that IVL and UM may have similar dysregulated gene networks. They may be closely related, and HOXA13 may serve as a biomarker to distinguish between IVL and UM."

Here we have harnessed the haplotype-based method fineSTRUCTURE in an Irish genome-wide SNP dataset, identifying 23 discrete genetic clusters which segregate with geographical provenance. Cluster diversity is pronounced in the west of Ireland but reduced in the east where older structure has been eroded by historical migrations. Accordingly, when populations from the neighbouring island of Britain are included, a west-east cline of Celtic-British ancestry is revealed along with a particularly striking correlation between haplotypes and geography across both islands. A strong relationship is revealed between subsets of Northern Irish and Scottish populations, where discordant genetic and geographic affinities reflect major migrations in recent centuries. Additionally, Irish genetic proximity of all Scottish samples likely reflects older strata of communication across the narrowest inter-island crossing.  Using GLOBETROTTER we detected Irish admixture signals from Britain and Europe and estimated dates for events consistent with the historical migrations of the Norse-Vikings, the Anglo-Normans and the British Plantations. The influence of the former is greater than previously estimated from Y chromosome haplotypes. In all, we paint a new picture of the genetic landscape of Ireland, revealing structure which should be considered in the design of studies examining rare genetic variation and its association with traits."

EGAS00001002705, exome sequencing  cell free dna reveals temporo spatial heterogeneity  identifies treatment resistant clones  neuroblastoma,"Background: Neuroblastoma (NB) displays important clinical and genetic heterogeneity, with emergence of new mutations at tumor progression. Patients and Methods: To study clonal evolution during treatment and follow-up, an innovative method based on circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analysis by whole exome sequencing (WES) paired with target sequencing was realized in sequential liquid biopsy samples of 19 NB patients. Results: WES of the primary tumor and cfDNA at diagnosis showed overlap of Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) and Copy Number Alterations (CNAs), with 41% and 93% of all detected alterations common to the primary NB and cfDNA. CfDNA WES at a second time point indicated a mean of 22 new SNVs for patients with progressive disease. Relapse-specific alterations included genes of the MAPK pathway and targeted the protein kinase A signaling pathway. Deep coverage target sequencing of intermediate timepoints during treatment and follow-up identified distinct subclones. For 17 seemingly relapse-specific SNVs detected by sequencing detected these alterations in minor subclones, with relapse-emerging SNVs targeting genes of neuritogenesis and cell cycle. Furthermore a persisting, resistant clone with concomitant disappearance of other clones was identified by a mutation in the ubiquitin protein ligase HERC2. Conclusion: Modelisation of mutated allele fractions in cfDNA indicated distinct patterns of clonal evolution, with either a minor, treatment-resistant clone expanding to a major clone at relapse, or minor clones collaborating towards tumor progression. Identification of treatment-resistant clones will enable development of more efficient treatment strategies.cfDNA WES at relapse but not tumor or cfDNA WES at diagnosis, deep coverage target."

Our studies will focus primarily on cardiovascular-related quantitative traits, obesity and related metabolic traits, neurodevelopmental disorders and a limited number of extreme clinical phenotypes that will provide proof-of-concept for future familial trait sequencing. We will analyse directly quantitative traits in the cohorts and the selected traits in the extreme samples, and also use imputation down to 0.1% allele frequency to extend the analyses to further sample sets with genome wide genotype data. In each case we will investigate indels and larger structural variants as well as SNPs, and use statistical methods that combine rare variants in a locus or pathway as well as single-variant approaches. The TEDS sample set comes from an epidemiological study, the “Twins Early Development Study”, which were screened for ASD (autism spectrum disorders).

Thisproblem is particularly pronounced in tissues with restricted regenerative potential such as thenervous system. However, advances in the fields of pluripotent stem cells (PSC) and cellprogramming provide unprecedented opportunities to generate safe donor cells for all humantissues and organs in virtually unlimited numbers. These advances include: (i) the availabilityof clinical grade human embryonic stem cells; (ii) the capability to reprogramme patientsomatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC); (iii) protocols for differentiating orforward programming PSC into therapeutically relevant somatic cell types; (iv) technologiesfor directly converting tissue-specific cells into other somatic cell fates; (v) methods forgenetic modification without collateral damage of the donor cell genome; vi) tools foridentifying and monitoring genetic and epigenetic changes that may have significantconsequences for safety and functional efficacy of PSC and their derivatives. Harnessingthese advances will enable an array of novel cell-mediated therapies. A prerequisite for therealisation of such therapeutic ambitions is a translational structure that melds fundamentaldiscoveries into a pipeline for medical products and applications.BCPP will concentrate in-house activities on PSC and derivative tissue stem cellintermediates. However, the field in general will also benefit from tackling key knowledgegaps including: (i) establishment of standardised systems for the generation of robustgenetically stable human PSC populations suitable for therapeutic translation, (ii)development and implementation of genetic modification tools that bypass the risk ofinsertional mutagenesis and are subject to science-based risk assessment, (iii) developmentof effective, reliable and reproducible differentiation protocols yielding functional and clinicallycompliant tissue-specific donor cells, (iv) quality control systems suitable for consistentmanufacturing of stem cells and differentiated progeny suitable for use in human applications.BCPP will implement a translational research programme to reach the following goals:Tools for monitoring and assessing the significance of genetic and epigenetic variation inPSCs.Qualified methods that minimise the occurrence of functionally significant variants ofundifferentiated ES and iPS cells and their differentiated derivatives during generation andexpansion.Standardised, integration-free and clinically compliant technologies for iPS cell productionand direct cell fate conversion.Technology for large-scale production from PSCs of standardised tissue-specific stem andprogenitor cells suitable for preparation of cell-based medicines.Regulatory compliant procedures and best practice documents for producing safe pluripotentstem cell-derived somatic phenotypes suitable for clinical trials.Added ValueThe combination of WT/MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute (SCI), the Sheffield Centre forStem Cell Biology (CSCB), Sanger Institute (WTSI), and Babraham Institute constitutesunmatched strength in the UK for development of enabling technologies in the field of PSCbiology, reprogramming and differentiation.

EGAS00001000642,quantification  chromosomal copy number aberrations  shallow  genome sequencing,"Detection of DNA copy number aberrations by shallow whole-genome sequencing (WGS) faces many challenges including lack of completion and errors in the human reference genome, repetitive sequences, polymorphisms, variable sample quality, and biases in the sequencing procedures.Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) archival material, the analysis of which is important for studies of cancer, presents particular analytical difficulties due to degradation of the DNA and frequent lack of matched reference samples. We present a robust, cost-effective WGS method for DNA copy number analysis that addresses these challenges more successfully than currently available procedures. In practice very useful profiles can be obtained with 0.1 fold genome coverage. We improve on previous methods by; first, implementing a combined correction for sequence mappability and GC content, and second, applying this procedure to sequence data from the 1000 Genomes Project in order to develop a blacklist of problematic genome regions. A small subset of these blacklisted regions were previously identified by ENCODE, but the vast majority are novel unappreciated problematic regions. Our procedures are implemented in a pipeline called QDNAseq. We have analyzed over 1,000 samples, most of which were obtained from the fixed tissue archives of over 25 institutions.We demonstrate that for most samples our sequencing and analysis procedures yield genome profiles with noise levels near the statistical limit imposed by read counting. The described procedures also provide better correction of artifacts introduced by low DNA quality than prior approaches, and better copy number data than high-resolution microarrays at substantially lower cost."

Major drawbacks with TKIs are their low efficacy in eradicating the leukemic stem cells responsible for disease maintenance and relapse upon TKI cessation. Here, we performed RNA-sequencing of flow-sorted primitive (CD34+CD38low) and progenitor (CD34+CD38+) chronic phase CML cells and identified transcriptional upregulation of 32 cell surface molecules relative to corresponding normal bone marrow cells. Focusing on novel markers with increased expression on primitive CML cells, we confirmed upregulation of the scavenger receptor CD36 and the leptin receptor (LEPR) by flow cytometry. We also delineate a subpopulation of primitive CML cells expressing CD36 that is less sensitive to imatinib treatment. Using CD36 targeting antibodies, we show that the CD36 positive cells can be targeted and killed by antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In summary, CD36 defines a subpopulation of primitive CML cells with decreased imatinib sensitivity that can be effectively targeted by ADCC using an anti-CD36 antibody."

We analyzed the oral (n=86)and gut (n=43) 16S microbiome in melanoma patients on PD-1 blockade. Significant differences were noted in the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome between responders and non-responders in patients with a fecal microbiome sample, with significantly higher alpha diversity and relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae bacteria) in R. Metagenomic studies (n=25) revealed functional differences in gut bacteria in R including enrichment of anabolic pathways. Immune profiling demonstrated enhanced systemic and anti-tumor immunity in patients with a favorable gut microbiome as well as in germ-free mice receiving fecal transplant from responding patients. Together, these data have important implications for treatment with immune checkpoint blockade in cancer.

We performed three independent in vitro differentiations towards the pancreatic endocrine lineage. We FACS-purified GFP positive and negative cells from stage 7 cultures, and generated Smart-Seq2 RNA-sequencing libraries for the pre-sorted cells, as well as the two GFP-sorted cell populations. Gene expression profiling by RNA-sequencing reveals that the NKX6.1-positive population closely resembles mature human beta cells and the functional evaluation of purified populations shows that the glucose-responsive beta-like cells are enriched within the NKX6.1-positive population. These reporter lines provide a valuable resource to the scientific community for the derivation of functional relevant pancreas and neuronal cell subtypes."
EGAS00001002323, immune microenvironment genome wide copy number aberrations  survival  mesothelioma,"IntroductionResults of recent clinical studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) have dampened initial enthusiasm. However, the immune environment and targets of these treatments such as program cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 have not been well characterised in MPM. Using a large cohort of patients, we investigated PD-L1 expression, immune infiltrates and genome-wide copy number status and correlated them to clinicopathological features.Patients and methodsTissue microarrays were constructed and stained with PD-L1(clone E1L3N, CST), CD4, CD8 and FOXP3 antibodies. PD-L1 positivity was defined as ≥5% membranous staining regardless of intensity and PD-L1+hi as ≥50%. Genomic DNA from a representative subset of 113 patients was used for genome-wide copy number analysis. The percent genome alteration (PGA) was computed as a proxy for genomic instability, and statistical analyses were used to relate copy number aberrations (CNA) to other variables.ResultsAmongst 329 patients evaluated, PD-L1+ was detected in 130/311 (41.7%), but PD-L1+hi was only seen in 30/311 (9.6%). PD-L1+ correlated with non–epithelioid histology and increased infiltration with CD4+, CD8+ and FOXP3+ lymphocytes. PD-L1+hi expression correlated with worse prognosis (HR = 2.37; 95%CI= 1.57-3.56; P &lt; 0.001) on univariate analysis, but not in multivariate analysis. Higher PGA was associated with epithelioid histology and poorer survival (HR = 1.59; 95%CI= 1.01-2.5; P = 0.04), but not PD-L1 expression.ConclusionPD-L1 expression was associated with non-epithelioid MPM, poor clinical outcome and increased immunological infiltrates. Increased genomic instability did not correlate with PD-L1 expression, but was associated with poorer survival."

For 3 patients we analyze the phylogeny of the lesions using exome sequencing, including one case with a total of 8 samples from the two lesions.

These samples include normal and tumor tissues from two different organs (liver and colon), that we extracted with three different FFPE extraction kits (QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue kit and GeneRead DNA FFPE kit from Qiagen, Maxwell\textsuperscript{TM} RSC DNA FFPE Kit from Promega). Variant calling analysis shows a very high rate of concordance between matched FF / FFPE pairs and equivalent performance for the three kits we analyzed. We find a significant variation in the difference of total number of variants called between FF and FFPE samples for the three different FFPE DNA extraction kits. Coverage analysis shows that FFPE samples have less good indicators than FF samples, yet the coverage quality remains above accepted thresholds. We detect limited but significant variations in coverage indicator values between the three FFPE extraction kits. Globally, the GeneRead and QIAamp kits have better variant calling and coverage indicators than the Maxwell kit on the samples used in this study, although this kit performs better on some indicators and has advantages in terms of practical usage. Taken together, our results confirm the potential of FFPE samples analysis for clinical genomic studies, but also indicate that the choice of a FFPE DNA extraction kit should be done with careful testing and analysis beforehand in order to maximize the accuracy of the results."

To assess the risk of in vitro expansion on mutation accumulation we have performed whole genome sequencing of clonally expanded human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) and adult stem cells (ASCs) to identify all mutations that accumulated over a fixed culture period. We find that ASCs acquire more single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels per population doubling than the iPS cells. When compared with ASCs, iPS cells are more vulnerable to mutations in genes and promoters. Mutational analysis revealed a clear in vitro induced mutational signature that is irrespective of stem cell type. This in vitro signature is characterized by C to G transversions that are probably caused by oxidative stress. Additionally, we observed stem cell specific mutational signatures and differences in transcriptional strand bias, indicating differential activity of DNA repair mechanisms between stem cell types in culture. In conclusion, in vitro culture induces mutation accumulation in iPS cells and ASCs. Culture under low-oxygen tension may help to reduce the number of culture-induced mutations."

The vast majority of interactions are uncharted, constituting a major missing link in understanding genome control. Here we use promoter capture Hi-C to identify interacting regions of 31,253 promoters in 17 human primary haematopoietic cell types. We show that long-range promoter interactions are highly cell-type specific, preferentially linking active promoters and enhancers. Patterns of promoter interactions reflect cell lineage relationships of the hematopoietic tree, consistent with dynamic remodeling of nuclear architecture during differentiation. Interacting regions are enriched for expression quantitative trait loci with effects on their interacting target genes.  We exploit this rich resource of interactome maps to connect non-coding disease variants to their target promoters, identifying thousands of new disease-candidate genes, and implicating a number of gene pathways in disease susceptibility. Our results demonstrate the power of promoter interactomes from primary cells to reveal insights into genomic regulatory mechanisms underlying common diseases."

EGAS00001002511,genomic  epigenomic characterization  juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia jmml,"Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is an aggressive myeloproliferative disorder of early childhood. While some cases show spontaneous remission, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only curative treatment option for the majority of patients, however, the 5-year event-free survival reaches only about 50%. Hyperactive RAS signaling is assumed to be the main driving event in JMML. It is caused by genetic alterations in CBL, KRAS, NF1, NRAS, or PTPN11 in about 90% of patients. So far, there is no clear understanding of how RAS pathway mutations relate to the heterogeneous disease biology and variable clinical outcome seen in JMML patients. As a consequence, established clinical and genetic markers fail to fully represent the observed disease heterogeneity. We hypothesized that DNA methylation profiling, either alone or in combination with genetic alterations, might provide a molecular basis for disease classification. Genome wide DNA methylation analysis using the HumanMethylation450 Bead Chip array was performed in a discovery cohort of 20 patients (19 JMML, 1 Noonan syndrome). The clinical relevance of our findings was assessed in an unselected sample set consisting of 147 consecutive patients with JMML (n=129) or Noonan syndrome (n=18) associated myeloproliferative disorder (n=18) registered in the EWOG-MDS 1998 &amp; 2006 trials. Data integration was performed in a subset of patients with available exome sequencing (n=50) and expression profiling (n=15) data. This integrated approach identified three JMML subgroups characterized by distinct clinical and biological features. This analysis further suggested a molecular mechanism by which additional genetic events, presumably further activating the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, mediate DNA hypermethylation via up-regulation of DNMTs in more aggressive JMML cases."

METHODSMultiregion high-depth whole-exome sequencing (M-seq) was performed on 100 early stage NSCLC tumors resected prior to systemic therapy. A total of 327 tumor regions were sequenced and analyzed to define evolutionary histories, obtain a census of clonal and subclonal events, and assess the relationship between ITH and recurrence-free survival (RFS).  RESULTSWidespread ITH was observed for both somatic copy number alterations (median 48% [0.03-88%]) and mutations (median 30% [0.5-93%]). Driver mutations in EGFR, MET, BRAF and TP53 were almost always clonal. However, heterogeneous driver alterations occurring later in evolution were found in over 75% of tumors and were common in PIK3CA, NF1 and genes involved in chromatin modification and DNA response and repair. Genome doubling and ongoing dynamic chromosomal instability (CIN), illustrated by mirrored subclonal allelic imbalance, were identified as causes of ITH resulting in parallel evolution of driver copy number events, including amplifications of CDK4, FOXA1, and BCL11A. Elevated copy number heterogeneity was associated with shorter RFS (HR=4.9, P=0.00044), which remained significant in a multivariate analysis.CONCLUSIONSITH mediated through CIN, rather than point mutational heterogeneity, was associated with increased risk of relapse, supporting its value as a prognostic predictor, and the need to target this high-risk phenotype."

Here we report findings derived from whole exome sequencing of 15 EATL-II tumor-normal tissue pairs. The tumor suppressor gene SETD2 encoding a non-redundant H3K36-specific trimethyltransferase is altered in 14/15 cases (93%), mainly by loss-of-function mutations and/or loss of the corresponding locus (3p21.31). These alterations consistently correlate with defective H3K36 trimethylation. The JAK/STAT pathway comprises recurrent STAT5B (60%), JAK3 (46%) and SH2B3 (20%) mutations, including a STAT5B V712E activating variant. Additionally, frequent mutations in TP53, BRAF and KRAS are observed. Conversely, in EATL-I, no SETD2, STAT5B or JAK3 mutations are found, and H3K36 trimethylation is preserved. This study describes SETD2 inactivation as EATL-II molecular hallmark, supports EATL-I and -II being two distinct entities, and defines potential new targets for therapeutic intervention."

EGAS00001001705,cttv macrophage screen,"Macrophages are myeloid cells that perform crucial functions in innate immunity, and dysregulation of macrophage cellular function is implicated in a wide variety of disorders including asthma, atherosclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, neurodegeneration, fibrosis, arthritis and inflammatory bowel disorders. Development of therapeutic targets that alter key human macrophage cellular functions relies on a systematic approach for identifying genes that regulate the major macrophage cellular functions: proliferation, motility, phagocytosis and secretion. However, performing robust genetic screens is impossible in primary human macrophages due to their limited proliferative capacity and the small quantity of material available from any one donor. The goal of this project is to develop a robust genetic screening platform in human macrophages. In collaboration with the Pathogens group at WTSI, we have developed an experimental pipeline for generation of human macrophages that closely resemble their primary counterparts and recapitulate key cellular functions from induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSCs). We will use recently developed lentiviral CRISPR-guide RNA llibraries to perform genetic screens for key macrophage cellular phenotypes. As an initial exemplar assay we will perform a genetic screen for phagocytosis using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled zymosan particles. The cellular assay for phagocytosis is robust and there are already some well-characterised positive controls (ELMO1, GULP1). However, we anticipate that this platform can extend to any cell phenotype on which cells can be sorted,  synergising with ongoing CTTV initiatives in IBD and airway diseases, as well as with GSK interests in COPD. Initially, we will perform a direct comparison of cellular assay performance in primary blood monocyte-derived macrophages and IPS-derived macrophages. Primary macrophages will be derived from volunteers from the Cambridge BioResource that have also donated to the Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Initiative (HIPSCI). We will compare the transcriptomes of the IPS and blood derived macrophages in the cellular assay, for example before and after exposure to zymosan particles, using RNA-seq across a minimum of three biological replicates to identify any possible differences in response between the IPS-derived and the primary macrophages.  Following the pilot comparison, we will engineer an IPS line to endogenously express Cas9. We will comprehensively characterise the impact of endogenous Cas9 expression on the cells using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq. If significant impacts of Cas9 expression are indicated, we will modify the endogenous Cas9 to express with an inducible promoter. The engineered line will then be differentiated into embryoid bodies and subsequently into macrophages, a process taking 2-3 weeks. Following differentiation, macrophage precursors can be harvested weekly for up to 9 months, providing a continuous source of cellular material with cell numbers of the order of 10M per week easily achievable. Following differentiation, the cell population will be transduced with a genome-wide lentiviral library. Preliminary data suggests that transduction efficiencies of a lentiviral library in IPS-derived macrophages are between 10 and 20%, which is sufficient for complete genome coverage. Following transduction, a cellular assay will be performed to screen cells for a specific phenotype. For example, cells treated with FITC-labeled zymosan, fluoresce upon engulfment of the particle. Fluorescing cells will be flow sorted and guide RNAs (gRNAs) from the fluorescent and non fluorescent populations will be deep sequenced. We will compare gRNA frequency between the two populations to identify gRNAs that are at significantly higher frequency in the non-fluorescent population, indicating that the mutants inactivate genes that are necessary for phagocytosis. We will perform 5-10 replicate screens for each phenotype, and specific targets will be independently validated in both IPS and primary cells by mutating specific genes detected in the screen in a clonal population and their assay performance with the wild type line. Following development of the screening pipeline, we will extend screens to other macrophage cell phenotypes of interest, with input from GSK DPUs. Possible extensions could include macrophage proliferation, bacterial phagocytosis, autophagy or bacterial killing. This data is part of a pre-publication release.

The tree was calibrated with archaeological data from the initial expansion of the Sardinian population ~7,700 years ago.

Epidermal growth-factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth-factor (PDGF) receptors are frequently amplified and/or possess gain-of-function mutations in these tumors. Despite years of research into tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, clinical trials have shown disappointing efficacy. One of the underlying reasons is intra-tumor heterogeneity. To assess the effect of intra-tumor heterogeneity on gene expression, we derived a general approach to map single-cell expression profiles to sequentially-acquired mutations identified from exome sequencing. Using 288 single cells, we constructed high-resolution phylogenies of EGF-driven and PDGF-driven GBMs, modeling transcriptional kinetics during tumor evolution. A deletion in a PDGF-receptor domain involved in dimerization correlated to an up-regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in a proneural GBM, and ectopic expression of this mutant PDGFRA in vitro enhanced proliferation and invasiveness. Descending the phylogenetic tree of the PDGFR-driven tumor corresponded to a progressive induction of an oligodendrocyte progenitor-like cell type that expresses growth and angiogenic factors. In contrast, phylogenetic analysis of an EGFR-amplified tumor showed a gradual up-regulation of pro-invasive genes."

In contrast with studies of exceptional longevity, usually focused on centenarians, healthy aging is not associated with known longevity variants, but is associated with reduced genetic susceptibility to Alzheimer and coronary artery disease. Additionally, healthy aging is not associated with a decreased rate of rare pathogenic variants, potentially indicating the presence of disease-resistance factors. In keeping with this possibility, we identify suggestive common and rare variant genetic associations implying that protection against cognitive decline is a genetic component of healthy aging. These findings, based on a relatively small cohort, require independent replication.

Gene mutations underlying the molecular pathogenesis of the disease are incompletely characterized. Here, we describe novel somatic IL4R mutations in 15 out of 62 primary cases of PMBCL (24.2%) and in all PMBCL-derived cell lines tested. The majority of mutations (11/21; 52%) were hotspot single nucleotide variants in exon 8 leading to an I242N amino acid change in the transmembrane domain. Functional analyses establish this mutation as gain-of-function leading to constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and upregulation of downstream cytokine expression profiles and B cell specific antigens. Moreover, expression of I242N mutant IL4R in a mouse xenotransplantation model conferred growth advantage in vivo. The pattern of concurrent mutations within the JAK-STAT signaling pathway suggests additive/synergistic effects of these gene mutations contributing to lymphomagenesis. Our data establish IL4R mutations as novel driver alterations and provide a strong preclinical rationale for therapeutic targeting of JAK-STAT signaling in PMBCL."

Intersecting mutational signatures and immune analysis showed that foldback inversion genomic aberrations lead to worse outcomes even in the presence of cytotoxic TIL (n=433). Thus, regional variation in immune contexture mirrors the pattern of intraperitoneal malignant spread, provoking new perspectives for treatment of this challenging disease."

EGAS00001000668,study   consequences  prenatal famine exposure  dna methylation,"The potential of the epigenome to undergo environmentally-induced changes during early development is central to its postulated role in human disease. Here, we report a genome-scale view of DNA methylation differences after early gestational malnutrition that was caused by the Dutch Hunger Winter, a severe famine at the end of World War II. We adopted an annotation guided analysis of reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing data generated in 24 middle-aged individuals who had been exposed to famine in utero and 24 unexposed sibling controls.  We observed differential DNA methylation primarily at genomic regions with regulatory potential, including enhancers active during early development. In-depth annotation of 181 prenatally-induced differentially methylated regions (P-DMRs) showed that they were predominantly located in gene bodies and co-occurred with histone marks denoting an active state. In line with the early gestational timing of the exposure, the P-DMRs mapped to genes that were enriched for differential expression patterns during blastocyst development and early organogenesis. Validation and further explorative analyses of 6 P-DMRs mapping to SMAD7, CDH23, INSR, RFTN1, CPT1A and KLF13 highlighted the critical role of gestational timing, indicated that differential methylation extended along pathways involved in growth, development and metabolism, and suggested associations with birth weight and serum LDL cholesterol in adulthood and confirmed an enhancer function for the INSR and CPT1A P-DMRs.  Our results point toward a link between prenatal malnutrition and epigenetic modulation of growth and lipid metabolism that may underlie the adverse metabolic phenotype of exposed individuals in later life."

EGAS00001001896,molecular dissection  germline chromothripsis   developmental context,"Complex germline genomic rearrangements can affect many genes and regulatory elements, but the precise mechanisms that caused the phenotype of patients with such rearrangements are often unknown. To dissect the impact of germline chromothripsis in a relevant developmental context, we performed trio-based RNA expression analysis on blood cells,induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and iPS-cell derived neuronal cells from a patient with de novo germline chromothripsis and both healthy parents. In addition, we performed Hi-C on iPS cell-derived neural progenitors of the patient and the father to study the effects of the chromothripsis rearrangements on the architecture of the derivative
chromosomes. We demonstrate that a combination of patient-derived iPS cell differentiation and trio-based molecular profiling is a powerful approach to improve the interpretation of pathogenic complex genomic rearrangements."
EGAS00001000171,exome sequencing  blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasms,"Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare and aggressive haematological malignancy derived from precursors of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Due to the rarity of BPDCNs our knowledge of their molecular pathogenesis was until recently confined to observations describing reccurent chromosomal deletions involving chromosomes 5q, 12p, 13q, 6q, 15q and 9. A recent publication went on to delineate the common deleted regions using aCGH and demonstrated that these centred around known tumour suppressor genes including CDKN2A/B (9p21.3), RB1 (12p13.2-14.3), CDKN1B (13q11-q12) and IKZF1 (7p12.2).These mutations are found recurrently in several different cancers and in most cases are thought to be involved in tumour progression rather than initiation. However, the well-defined nature and cellular ontogeny of these neoplasms suggests strongly that they share one or a few characteristic mutations as has been demonstrated for other uncommon but well-defined neoplasms such as Hairy Cell Leukemia (BRAF) and ovarian Granulosa Cell tumours (FOXL2)."
EGAS00001001911,lineage specific genome architecture links disease variants  target genes,"Long-range interactions between DNA regulatory elements and their target genes play major roles in gene regulation. The vast majority of interactions are uncharted, constituting a major missing link in understanding genome control. Here we use promoter capture Hi-C to identify interacting regions of 31,253 promoters in 17 human primary haematopoietic cell types. We show that long-range promoter interactions are highly cell-type specific, preferentially linking active promoters and enhancers. Patterns of promoter interactions reflect cell lineage relationships of the hematopoietic tree, consistent with dynamic remodeling of nuclear architecture during differentiation. Interacting regions are enriched for expression quantitative trait loci with effects on their interacting target genes.  We exploit this rich resource of interactome maps to connect non-coding disease variants to their target promoters, identifying thousands of new disease-candidate genes, and implicating a number of gene pathways in disease susceptibility. Our results demonstrate the power of promoter interactomes from primary cells to reveal insights into genomic regulatory mechanisms underlying common diseases."

EGAS00001000653,cd74 nrg1 fusions  lung adenocarcinoma,"We discovered a novel somatic gene fusion, CD74-NRG1, by transcriptome sequencing of 25 lung adenocarcinomas of never smokers. By screening 102 lung adenocarcinomas negative for known oncogenic alterations we found four additional fusion-positive tumors, all of which were of the invasive mucinous subtype. Mechanistically, CD74-NRG1 leads to extracellular expression of the EGF-like domain of NRG1 III-beta3, thereby providing the ligand for ERBB2-ERBB3 receptor complexes. Accordingly, ERBB2 and ERBB3 expression was high in the index case and expression of phospho-ERBB3 was specifically found in tumors bearing the fusion (p&lt;0.0001). Ectopic expression of CD74-NRG1 in lung cancer cell lines expressing ERBB2 and ERBB3 activated ERBB3 and the PI3K-AKT pathway, and led to increased colony formation in soft agar. Thus, CD74-NRG1 gene fusions are activating genomic alterations in invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas and may offer a therapeutic opportunity for a lung tumor subtype with, so far, no effective treatment."
EGAS00001000582,resistance  anti egfr therapy  colorectal cancer,"Monoclonal antibodies targeting the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), such as cetuximab and panitumumab, have evolved to important therapeutic options in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). However, almost all patients with clinical response to anti-EGFR therapies show disease progression within a few months and little is known about mechanism and timing of resistance evolution. Here we performed whole genome sequencing of plasma DNA (plasma-Seq) from patients treated with anti-EGFR therapy. We demonstrate that development of resistance to anti-EGFR therapies is frequently associated with focal amplifications of KRAS, MET, and ERBB2. However, we also show that focal KRAS amplifications can be acquired in tumor genomes of patients under cytotoxic chemotherapy. Furthermore, we provide evidence that specific chromosomal polysomies, such as overrepresentations of 12p and 7p, harboring KRAS and EGFR, respectively, determine responsiveness to anti-EGFR therapy. In contrast, employing ultra-sensitive deep sequencing of genes associated with anti-EGFR resistance, such as KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and EGFR, we did not observe the occurrence of novel, acquired mutations. Overall, whole-genome plasma DNA sequencing represents a non-invasive blood-based surrogate measure of changes in tumors. As such, plasma-Seq enables the identification of novel mutant clones and may therefore facilitate early adjustments of therapies that may delay or prevent disease progression."
EGAS00001001926,mesenchymal inflammation drives genotoxic stress  hematopoietic stem cells  predicts disease evolution  human pre leukemia,"Mesenchymal niche cells may drive tissue failure and malignant transformation in the hematopoietic system but the molecular mechanisms and their relevance to human disease remain poorly defined. We demonstrated that perturbation of mesenchymal cells in a mouse model of the preleukemic disorder Shwachman-Diamond syndrome induces mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and activation of DNA damage responses in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. In this study we demonstrate, through massive parallel RNA sequencing of highly purified mesenchymal cells in a range of human preleukemic syndromes, TP53-S100A8/9-TLR4 inflammatory signaling as a common driving mechanism of genotoxic stress, which could be attenuated by TLR4 blockade. S100A8/9 expression in mesenchymal cells predicted outcome in myelodysplastic syndromes, the principal human preleukemic condition, independent of known prognostic variables. Collectively, findings reveal a concept of mesenchymal niche-induced genotoxic stress in heterotypic stem and progenitor cells through inflammatory signaling as an actionable determinant of disease outcome in human preleukemia. The data further provide novel conceptual and mechanistic insights into the intimate link between inflammation and cancer."
EGAS00001000660,high number  somatic mutations    healthy blood compartment   115 year  woman reveals oligoclonal hematopoiesis,"The somatic mutation burden in healthy white blood cells (WBCs) is not well known. Based on deep whole genome sequencing, we estimate that ~450 somatic mutations accumulated in the non-repetitive genome within the healthy blood compartment of a 115-year old woman. The detected mutations appear to have been harmless passenger mutations: they were enriched in non-coding, AT-rich regions that are not evolutionarily conserved, and they were depleted for genomic elements where mutations might have favorable or adverse effects on cellular fitness, such as regions with actively transcribed genes.The distribution of variant allele frequencies of these mutations suggests that the majority of the peripheral white blood cells were offspring of two related hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) clones. Moreover, telomere lengths of the WBCs were significantly shorter than telomere lengths from other tissues. Together, this suggests that the finite lifespan of HSCs, rather than somatic mutation effects, may lead to hematopoietic clonal evolution at extreme ages."

Highly penetrant diseases alleles are found in a significant minority of cases, and common risk alleles are present in a large proportion. Given the central role of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of these disorders, it is critical that mechanistic studies in human subjects and tissue samples are interpreted in an genetically enlightened context. To address this we performed exome sequencing on 1461 human brains accessible through the Medical Research Council (UK) brain banks network.

EGAS00001002834,role  cell division  mesendoderm formation rna seq analysis,"We have demonstrated that pluripotent stem cells divide two times during endoderm differentiation. The first division occur at about 20h after the induction of differentiation.  In order to determine whether this cell division is couple to the epigenetic changes that take place during this differentiation process, we carried out ChIP-seq experiments for two histone marks widely known for their role in specification of active and inactive gene promoter enhancers (H3K27Ac and H3K4me1). These experiments are accompanied by RNA seq analysis.
To this end, we conducted the following: H9 cells were synchronized in G2/M and then differentiated into endoderm for 24h, in presence or absence of different agents capable of blocking cells in specific phases of the cell cycle (Hydroxyurea: S-phase; Nocodazole: G2/M phase). Cells were collected at different time points. 12h after differentiation: Majority of the cells should be in S phase. In presence of Hidroxyurea (HU), cells should not live S phase and therefore, by the end of the experiment (24h-HU) those cells should still be in S phase; Nocodazole (Noc) was added after 12h of differentiation with the goal of blocking cells in the first G2/M phase during differentiation. Majority of these cells should be in G2/M by the end of the experiment (24h-Noc). Synchronized cells that differentiated normally in absence of these two drugs (E24h), will pass the first cell division, and be manly in G1/S phases of the cell cycle."
EGAS00001001238,targeted replication  lvoto genes,"Non-syndromic cases of congenital heart defects (CHD) exhibit variable modes of inheritance (Mendelian and non-Mendelian). Several studies have identified strong candidates in humans by taking a candidate gene approach as well as by using whole exome next generation sequencing (NGS). So far these studies could only explain a minor fraction of the observed phenotype in humans, most of them in syndromic cases and no single study has focused on the subset of cases with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO). To discover novel disease-causing genes a large cohort of patients with LVOTO, approximately 100 cases, 25 families and 100 trios have been exome sequenced. This study based on NGS sequencing data yielded several known and novel compelling candidate genes, such as MYH6, NR2F2 and MYH11, but also novel ones, such as ITGB4. To evaluate the significance of our findings in a replication cohort we assembled another 1614 cases with an LVOTO phenotype from our collaborators in Toronto, Berlin and Amsterdam. Targeted resequencing in this additional cohort will help to find additional cases with mutations in the identified candidate genes to strengthen genotype-phenotype association. We will use control data from the INTERVAL project for case/control analyses The pulldowns will be performed as 24-plex ISC with 192 or greater indexes, and the sequencing will be performed with 192 samples per lane, requiring 9 lanes of sequencing."

Somatic IKZF1 alterations result in the acquisition of stem cell-like features, overexpression of adhesion molecules causing aberrant cell-cell and cell-stroma interaction, and decreased sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In this study, we sought to comprehensively characterize germline IKZF1 genetic variation and to determine the extent to which they contribute to predisposition to ALL. We identified coding IKZF1 variation in familial childhood ALL and 1% of presumed sporadic B-ALL, with 28 unique germline IKZF1 variants in 45 children. The majority of variants adversely affected IKZF1 function and drug responsiveness of leukemic cells. Here, we report whole exome and RNA sequencing, and single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis, for all available patient samples to identify potential collaborating genetic events that were somatically acquired in our cohort of patients harboring germline IKZF1 variants."

Children presenting with multiple de novo leukemias are more likely to suffer from genetic predisposition. Here, we selected five of these patients and analyzed the mutational spectrum of normal and malignant tissues. In two patients, we identified germline mutations in TYK2, a member of the JAK tyrosine kinase family. These mutations were located in two adjacent codons of the pseudokinase domain (p.Pro760Leu and p.Gly761Val). In silico modeling revealed that both mutations affect the conformation of this auto-regulatory domain. Consistent with this notion, both germline mutations promote TYK2 autophosphorylation and activate downstream STAT family members, which could be blocked with the JAK kinase inhibitor I. These data indicate that germline activating TYK2 mutations predispose to the development of ALL."

EGAS00001002577,direct detection  early stage cancers  circulating tumor dna,"Early detection and intervention are likely to be the most effective means for reducing morbidity and mortality of human cancer. However, development of methods for noninvasive detection of early-stage tumors has remained a challenge. We have developed an approach called targeted error correction sequencing (TEC-Seq) that allows ultrasensitive direct evaluation of sequence changes in circulating cell-free DNA using massively parallel sequencing. We have used this approach to examine 58 cancer-related genes encompassing 81 kb. Analysis of plasma from 44 healthy individuals identified genomic changes related to clonal hematopoiesis in 16% of asymptomatic individuals but no alterations in driver genes related to solid cancers. Evaluation of 200 patients with colorectal, breast, lung, or ovarian cancer detected somatic mutations in the plasma of 71, 59, 59, and 68%, respectively, of patients with stage I or II disease. Analyses of mutations in the circulation revealed high concordance with alterations in the tumors of these patients. In patients with resectable colorectal cancers, higher amounts of preoperative circulating tumor DNA were associated with disease recurrence and decreased overall survival. These analyses provide a broadly applicable approach for noninvasive detection of early-stage tumors that may be useful for screening and management of patients with cancer."

However, adoption of new approaches by clinical laboratories requires careful evaluation of all potential sources of error and the development of strategies to ensure the highest accuracy. Timely and efficient clinical use of HTS platforms will depend on combining multiple samples (multiplexing) in each sequencing run. Here we examine immunoglobulin heavy chain gene HTS on the Illumina MiSeq platform for MRD (HTS-MRD). We identify errors associated with multiplexing that could potentially impact on the accuracy of MRD analysis. We optimise a strategy combining high purity, sequence-optimised oligonucleotides, dual-indexing and an error-aware demultiplexing approach to minimise errors and maximise sensitivity. We present a probability-based demultiplexing pipeline, Error-Aware Demultiplexer (EAD) - that is suitable for all MiSeq sequencing strategies and accurately assigns samples to the correct identifier without excessive loss of data. Finally using controls quantified by digital PCR, we show that HTS-MRD can accurately detect as few as 1 in 106 copies of specific leukemic MRD."

In recent years, a number of statistical techniques and strategies have been widely described making much easier overcoming X-chromosome technical hurdles and including this region within genetic studies. Tenomodulin (TNMD) is a Xq22 chromosome anti angiogenic locus which has been recently linked to different obesity-related phenotypes. These results have not been replicated to date. Given these facts, we have conducted a genetic association analysis in Spanish children population including seven TNMD SNPs as potential candidate markers for obesity and metabolic dysfunctions. Additionally genotypes for another locus located in the X chromosome, the SLC6A14, have been included in the dataset.

A total of 915 DNA samples from 258 normal weight, 177 overweight and 480 obese Spanish children (438 males, 477

This project study the effect of a leading clinical drug that specifically targets the gene product of PIK3CA. Although this drug works well in HNSCC, it is anticipated that some patients will become resistant to it over time and will stop responding, as this has been observed when other 'targeted' drugs are used in other cancers. The goal here is to determine what molecular mechanisms are involved with mediating resistance over time to the PIK3CA drug. The drug is called ""BYL719"". A mouse xenograft model was created in this effect. Basically, a tumour from a patient with HNSCC was engrafted in multiple mice, and once it grew, the mice were treated with BYL719 or a vehicle (corn oil). Over time, the corn oil mice's tumours grow very quickly. The BYL719-treated mice's tumours are static for about the first 50 days of treatment (suggesting the drug is quite effective), but then begin to resume growth (suggesting they have become resistant to the drug). With the tumours collected from the mice at the end point of the study, we are using a multi-platform approach to figure out what the differences are in the BYL719-resistant tumours, compared to the corn oil tumours, primary tumour (never engrafted into mice) and the patient blood."

The resulting subtype-specific expression profiles will support the development of reliable and robust biomarkers to more accurately and reliably classify medulloblastomas for treatment in clinical trials. For that purpose, two assays will be developed: an antibody-based immunohistochemical assay and an orthogonal nucleic acid-based hybridization assay.
Additional genomic DNA analysis of the 300 high risk subgroup cases will support the discovery of subgroup specific somatic mutations in order to inform current clinical trials of targeted therapies, and to identify genes and pathways already targeted in other diseases.

We developed a novel method to call high and low frequency mutations, to cluster them according to their frequencies and rebuild the proliferation trees directly from these mutation clusters using a recursive algorithm. The trees of all four lesions were formed of a dominant subclone that coexisted with other genetically heterogeneous subpopulations of cells. Despite this similar hierarchical organization, however, the growth dynamics varied among and within tumors, likely depending on a combination of tumor-specific genetic and environmental factors. Our study provides insights into the biological properties of individual MMR deficient colorectal adenomas that may influence their growth and also the response to therapy. Extended to other solid tumors, our approach could inform on the mechanisms of cancer progression, thus providing insight into the best choice of cancer treatment methods."

In this pilot phase of the project we will perform 15X whole-genome sequencing of a small number of crypts biopsied from four patients. Biopsies have been taken from inflammed and noninflammed patches to compare mutation rates and mutational signatures. We will also test if crypts from inflammed patches of a single patient are clonal (either within a given inflammed patch or across inflammed patches). We will quantify the rate of cancer driver mutations in inflammed and non-inflammed crypts.

EGAS00001002830,single cell sequencing reveals  origin   order  mutation acquisition  t cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"Next-generation sequencing has provided a detailed overview of the various genomic lesions implicated in the pathogenesis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Typically, 10 to 20 genomic lesions are found in T-ALL cells at diagnosis. However, it is currently unclear in which order these mutations are acquired and in which progenitor cells this is initiated. To address these questions, we used targeted single-cell sequencing of total bone marrow cells and CD34+CD38- multipotent progenitor cells for 4 T-ALL cases. Hierarchical clustering detected a dominant leukemia clone at diagnosis, accompanied by a few subclones harboring only a fraction of the mutations. We developed a graph-based algorithm to determine the order of mutation acquisition. Two of the four patients had an early event in a known oncogene (MED12, STAT5B) amongst various pre-leukemic events. Intermediate events included loss of 9p21 (CDKN2A/B) and acquisition of fusion genes, while NOTCH1 mutations were typically late events. Analysis of CD34+CD38- cells and myeloid progenitors revealed that in half of the cases somatic mutations were detectable in multipotent progenitor cells. We demonstrate that targeted single cell sequencing can elucidate the order of mutation acquisition in T-ALL and that T-ALL development can start in a multipotent progenitor cell."
EGAS00001002786, empirical approach leveraging tumorgrafts  dissect  tumor microenvironment  renal cell carcinoma identifies missing link  prognostic inflammatory factors,"We undertook an empirical approach to dissect the tumor microenvironment by developing a bulk tumor dissection algorithm, DisHet, and leveraging RNA-Seq data of tumorgrafts (patient-derived tumors implanted in mice), in which only the tumor cell component expands. We found that approximately 65% of previously defined immune signature genes are not abundantly expressed in the Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) microenvironment, and we identified more than two times as many novel immune/stromal transcripts. By using refined immune/stroma-specific genes and genomics, electronic medical record data and imaging data  of 1084 RCC patients, we discovered a highly-inflamed pan-RCC subtype enriched for Treg cells, NK cells, Th1 cells, neutrophils, macrophages, B cells, and CD8+ T cells. This inflamed subtype (IS) is enriched for aggressive RCCs, including BAP1-deficient clear-cell and type 2 papillary tumors. Interestingly, IS is correlated with systemic manifestations of inflammation in patients such as thrombocytosis and anemia, whose pathogenesis were poorly defined and have been predictors of poor prognosis in RCC. Indeed, we discovered that IS is a strong predictor of poor survival. Lastly, our analyses show that tumor cells may drive stromal immune response. Overall, these data provide a missing link between the tumor cells, the tumor microenvironment, and systemic factors."

The results of this study show the importance of acquired mutations in MM driver genes, bi-allelic events affecting tumor suppressor genes and increased proliferation rates in driving relapse, which is enhanced by intra-clonal heterogeneity and Darwinian type clonal evolution. Branching was the most frequent evolution pattern, characterized by clonal loss and appearance of new clones. We found a higher number of lost and acquired copy number aberrations and an excess of bi-allelic inactivation of tumor suppressor genes in GEP70 high risk (HiR) cases, consistent with genomic instability being a key feature of HiR MM. In conclusion, our study further stresses the impact of known prognostic markers and driver genes on the fitness level of MM cells to survive multi-agent chemotherapy. The frequent bi-allelic loss of tumor suppressor genes in HiR cases and the potentially resulting failure of treatment with DNA damaging agents highlight the need for new therapies for HiR MM."

We compared molecular characteristics between primary GBM, neurospheres and orthotopic xenograft models derived from the same parental tumor. Driver alterations were in majority propagated from tumor to model systems. Extrachromosomal amplifications of MET, a proto-oncogene coding for a receptor tyrosine kinase, were detected in three primary GBM, largely discarded in neurospheres cultures, but resurfaced in xenografts. The clonal dynamics inferred by somatic single nucleotide variants (sSNVs) in MET-amplified samples diverged from the pattern delineated by the MET amplification event suggesting that the MET event and sSNVs were inherited in different manners. Our analysis shows that extrachromosomal elements are able to drive tumor progression."

However, the global landscape of the genetic changes in HCC genomes underpinning different epidemiological and ancestral backgrounds still remains uncharted. Here a collection of data from 503 liver cancer genomes from different populations uncovered 30 candidate driver genes and 11 core pathway modules. Furthermore, a collaboration of two large-scale cancer genome projects comparatively analyzed the trans-ancestry substitution signatures in 608 liver cancer cases and identified unique mutational signatures that predominantly contribute to Asian cases. This work elucidates previously unexplored ancestry-associated mutational processes in HCC development. A combination of hotspot TERT promoter mutation, TERT focal amplification and viral genome integration occurs in more than 68% of cases, implicating TERT as a central and ancestry-independent node of hepatocarcinogenesis. Newly identified alterations in genes encoding metabolic enzymes, chromatin remodelers and a high proportion of mTOR pathway activations offer potential therapeutic and diagnostic opportunities."

The TEENAGE study target population comprised adolescent students aged 13 to 15 years attending the first three classes of public secondary schools located in the wider Athens area of Attica. The regions across Attica from which students were recruited were physically similar and all urban in nature. Sampling of regions and schools selected to participate was random. Students were enrolled from the wider urban region to ensure that they were coming from families with varying educational background and socio-economic status. Moreover, in order to exclude any vast economic disparities, all participating schools were exclusively public schools, which are free of charge. A total of twenty-four schools participated in the study out of 285 junior secondary public schools in Attica. Anthropometric, medical and dietary information was obtained. DNA samples were genotyped using Illumina HumanCoreExome BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.

We found spatial genomic heterogeneity in a substantial proportion of cases including bi-allelic inactivation of tumor suppressors and mutations affecting cancer genes. The amount of heterogeneous mutations associated with the size of focal tumor lesions in whole body imaging consistent with focal outgrowth of highly advanced clones. In conclusion, our results support the regional initiation of transformation processes leading to high-risk disease as well as the pre-existence of key driver events in restricted areas. As such, our study does not only provide new insights in the underlying biology of MM progression but also has considerable implications for standard diagnostic approaches in the clinic."

The present series corresponds to 161 RNA-seq samples from tumors with matched WES or WGS. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for more than 90% of liver cancers, and is a major health problem. It is the 3rd cause of cancer-related mortality. Advances in genomic analyses have formed a comprehensive understanding of different underlying pathobiological layers resulting in hepatocarcinogenesis. Thus, the development of next-generation sequencing technologies has made it possible to generate more comprehensive catalogues of somatic alteration events (single nucleotide substitutions, structural variations, and epigenetic changes) in liver cancer genome than ever before."

Here, we interrogated longitudinal biopsies from a patient who initially responded to MEKi+CDK4i therapy but subsequently developed resistance. Whole exome sequencing and functional validation identified an acquired PIK3CAE545K mutation as conferring drug resistance. We demonstrate that PIK3CAE545K pre-existed in a rare subpopulation that was missed by both clinical and research testing, but was revealed upon multi-region sampling due to PIK3CAE545K being non-uniformly distributed. This resistant population rapidly expanded after the initiation of MEKi+CDK4i therapy and persisted in all successive samples even after immune checkpoint therapy and distant metastasis.  Functional studies identified activated S6K1 as both a key marker and specific therapeutic vulnerability downstream of PIK3CAE545K-induced resistance. These results demonstrate that comprehensive analysis of pre-treatment samples can reveal rare pre-existing resistant subpopulations and also posit S6K1 as a common downstream therapeutic nexus for the MAPK, CDK4/6, and PI3K pathways."

The examined Papuan genomes (hereafter taken as representative of the broader Sahul region) show an excess of haplotype sharing with Africans. This is compatible with traces of an early and otherwise extinct non-African lineage in the Papuan genome, evidence of which was so far only available in the Western Asian fossil record.

In addition to BRAF, N-RAS and H-RAS, which have previously been shown to be recurrently mutated in PTC, our analysis highlights additional genes, including thyroglobulin (TG), which harbored somatic mutations in 3% of the entire cohort.  Surprisingly, although TG mutations were not exclusive to mutations in the RAS-MAP kinase pathway, their presence was associated with a significantly worse clinical outcome, which suggests a pathogenic role beyond driving initial oncogenesis.  Analysis of metastatic PTC tissue revealed significant enrichment for TG mutations (p&lt;0.001), including events of apparent clonal expansion.  Our results suggest a previously unknown role of TG somatic mutations in the pathogenesis of PTC and its malignant evolution."

Many resistance mechanisms somehow lead to reactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), thereby restoring signalling of the oncogenic BRAF/MEK/ERK pathway. In addition, PI3K pathway activation contributes to resistance to BRAF inhibition. Less frequent but equally important to the phenomenon of targeted drug resistance is the observation that B15–20% of BRAF mutant melanoma patients fail to respond to BRAF inhibition already early on treatment, owing to intrinsic resistance. These patients have little therapeutic options, unless immunotherapy can be given. To better understand the resistance mechanisms in MAPK inhibitor-treated melanoma patients and melanoma biology, our lab generated a big panel of MAPK inhibitor resistant melanoma cell lines by continuous drug exposure. The understanding of the genetic landscape and gene expression as well as cross resistance to other treatment regimens, and other aspects of melanoma biology such as phenotype switch, will allow us to better exploit new therapeutic strategies for melanoma patients."

These sequences were long considered non-functional. However, evidence is beginning to merge that many of these repetitive sequences contain regulatory elements. Furthermore, deregulation of repetitive elements can cause genomic instability and has been observed in solid cancers. We investigated repeat expression in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in collaboration with the laboratory of Michael Luebbert at the University Hospital Freiburg by total-RNA sequencing of a small number of primary patient samples. Our analysis has given insights into aberrant repeat transcription in AML and helps elucidate the role of these aberrant transcripts in non-solid tumor cells."

EGAS00001002873,clonal haematopoiesis  patients  aaa,"Recent advances in genomics have demonstrated that clonal haemopoiesis driven by leukaemia associated somatic mutations is a relatively common phenomenon that increases in frequency with advancing age. Whilst individuals with clonal haemopoiesis have an increased risk of developing haematological malignancies, they also have an increased mortality from other causes. Additionally, certain mutations are almost exclusively seen in individuals aged 70 years or older, whilst others are seen in individuals with non-haematological cancers including breast and ovarian. Recently, clonal haemopoiesis was found to be associated with a significantly increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This association is thought to be causative with clonally-derived macrophages showing elevated expression of several chemokine and cytokine genes that contribute to atherosclerosis. 
Another vascular pathology, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), increases with age and shares risk factors with atherosclerosis (including smoking, male sex, high cholesterol). However, the impact of these risk factors and the overlap between AAA and atherosclerosis is poorly understood. To investigate a possible link between clonal haemopoiesis and AAA, we will study DNA samples from 300 patients with AAA and up to 200 controls for evidence of clonal haemopoiesis. This will be done using target DNA enrichment with biotinylated RNA baits followed by high throughput sequencing."

EGAS00001001026,prediction  quantification  splice events  rna seq data,"Analysis of splice variants from short read RNA-seq data remains a challenging problem. Here we present a novel method for the genome-guided prediction and quantification of splice events from RNA-seq data, which enables the analysis of unannotated and complex splice events. Splice junctions and exons are predicted from reads mapped to a reference genome and are assembled into a genome-wide splice graph. Splice events are identified recursively from the graph and are quantified locally based on reads extending across the start or end of each splice variant. We assess prediction accuracy based on simulated and real RNA-seq data, and illustrate how different read aligners (GSNAP, HISAT2, STAR, TopHat2) affect prediction results. We validate our approach for quantification based on simulated data, and compare local estimates of relative splice variant usage with those from other methods (MISO, Cufflinks) based on simulated and real RNA-seq data. In a proof-of-concept study of splice variants in 16 normal human tissues (Illumina Body Map 2.0) we identify 249 internal exons that belong to known genes but are not related to annotated exons. Using independent RNA samples from 14 matched normal human tissues, we validate 9/9 of these exons by RT-PCR and 216/249 by paired-end RNA-seq (2 x 250 bp). These results indicate that de novo prediction of splice variants remains beneficial even in well-studied systems. An implementation of our method is freely available as an R/Bioconductor package SGSeq."

Prenatal mutation rates are as yet unknown. Here we determined genome-wide mutation patterns of single stem cells in human development by sequencing of clonally expanded intestinal and liver organoid cultures of 2nd trimester human foetuses. Our results show that mutation rates in fetal stem cells are significantly higher than in adult stem cells.

Promoters of key lineage-specific differentiation genes are found in a repressed bivalent state, having both activating H3K4me3 and repressive H3K27me3 histone marks, making them poised for transcription upon loss of H3K27me3 in response to environmental cues. Whether the tumour-initiating, self-renewing, cancer-initiating cells (C-ICs) have similar epigenetic regulatory mechanism that prevent lineage commitment is unknown. In order to investigate bivalently marked and repressed promoters, we used a patient-derived CC-IC enriched model to identify the changes in transcriptome following inhibition of EZH2, the H3K27 methyltransferase. We also performed ChIP-seq for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 at baseline in order to identify repressed and bivalently marked promoters."

This revealed known and novel mutations in validated disease genes previously described in isolated families, which broadened the clinical phenotype of known disease genes. We have also reported several novel human disease genes.  The diagnostic yield was the same in both young and older-onset patients, including sporadic cases.

EGAS00001002894, light chain iglv3 21 defines   poor prognostic subgroup  chronic lymphocytic leukemia    multicenter study,"Purpose: Unmutated (UM) immunoglobulin heavy chain region (IgHV) status or IgHV3-21 gene usage is associated with poor prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Interestingly, IgHV3-21 is often co-expressed with light chain IgLV3-21 which is potentially able to trigger cell-autonomous BCR-mediated signaling. However this light chain has never been characterized independently of the heavy chain IgHV3-21.Experimental Design: we performed total RNA sequencing to characterize IgLV3-21 patients (n=32) and investigated IgLV3-21 prognostic impact in terms of treatment-free (TFS) and overall (OS) survival in 3 other independent cohorts for a total of 813 patients where IgLV3-21 presence was tested by real-time PCR and confirmed by Sanger sequencing.Results: Using total RNA sequencing to characterize 32 patients with high-risk CLL, we found a high frequency (28%) of IgLV3-21 rearrangements. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that these patients present higher expression of genes responsible for ribosome biogenesis and translation initiation (P&lt;0.0001) and MYC target genes (P=0.0003). Patients with IgLV3-21 rearrangements displayed a significantly shorter TFS and OS (P&lt;0.05), in particular in IgHV mutated patients. In each of the 3 independent validation cohorts (n=813), we showed that IgLV3-21 rearrangements -similar to UM IgHV status- conferred poor prognosis compared to mutated IgHV (P&lt;0.0001). Importantly, we confirmed in multivariate analysis that this was independent of IgHV mutational status or subset #2 stereotyped receptor (P&lt;0.0001). Conclusions: We therefore demonstrate for the first time that a light chain can impact on CLL prognosis and that IgLV3-21 light chain usage defines a new poor prognostic subgroup in CLL."

EGAS00001002893,exome sequencing demonstrates  dual origin  relapses  retinoic acid resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia,"Retinoic acid (RA) and arsenic target the PML/RARA driver of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL), their combination now curing over 95% patients. Here we report exome sequencing of 64 matched diagnosis/remission/relapses patients treated with historical RA/chemotherapy protocols. A first subgroup presents a high incidence of oncogenic mutations disrupting key epigenetic or transcriptional regulators (primarily WT1) or activating MAPK signaling at diagnosis. Relapses retain these cooperating oncogenes and exhibit additional oncogenic alterations and/or mutations impeding therapy response (RARA, NT5C2). The second group primarily exhibits FLT3 activation at diagnosis, which is lost upon relapse together with most other passenger mutations, implying that relapses derive from pre-leukemic PML/RARA-expressing cells that survived RA/chemotherapy. Accordingly, clonogenic activity of PML/RARA-immortalized progenitors ex vivo is only transiently affected by RA, but selectively abrogated by arsenic. Our studies stress the role of cooperating oncogenes in direct relapses and suggest that targeting pre-leukemic cells by arsenic contributes to its clinical efficacy."

Using whole-genome twin data to discriminate between correctly identified single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and errors a strategy for the accurate detection of SNVs was developed. By applying stringent sequencing quality measures, excluding error-prone regions and selecting SNVs identified by different mapping and variation calling algorithms, error rates were ~37-fold reduced. This enabled us to identify the first discordant SNVs in monozygotic twins using whole-genome sequencing. In addition, by showing that novel SNVs are highly enriched in errors, accurate estimates of the number of novel and rare SNVs occurring in unrelated Caucasian individuals were obtained. Finally, somatic mutations in coding and regulatory sequences were reliably identified in the highly rearranged ovarian tumor. Overall, our data demonstrate that strategies to reduce error rates in whole-genomes are required for disease gene discovery."

Frequent mutations in cytokine receptor and JAK/STAT signaling pathways led us to hypothesize that ETP-ALL is dependent on JAK/STAT signaling. Here we demonstrate aberrant activation of the JAK/STAT pathway in ETP-ALL blasts relative to non-ETP T-ALL. Moreover, ETP-ALL showed hyperactivation of STAT5 in response to IL7, an effect that was abrogated by the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. In vivo, ruxolitinib displayed activity in 6/6 patient-derived murine xenograft models of ETP-ALL, with profound single-agent efficacy in 5 models. Ruxolitinib treatment decreased peripheral blast counts relative to pre-treatment levels and compared to control (P&lt;0.01) in 5/6 ETP-ALL xenografts, with marked reduction in mean splenic blast counts (P&lt;0.01) in 6/6 samples. Surprisingly, both JAK/STAT pathway activation and ruxolitinib efficacy were independent of the presence of JAK/STAT pathway mutations, raising the possibility that the therapeutic potential of ruxolitinib in ETP-ALL extends beyond those cases with JAK mutations. These findings establish the preclinical in vivo efficacy of ruxolitinib in ETP-ALL, a biologically distinct subtype for which novel therapies are needed."

We used a custom-designed methylome panel to conduct targeted bisulphite sequencing based investigation of 5M CpGs located in regulatory or hypomethylated regions of circulating blood cells. Using binomial regression model, we investigated the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between ACPA positive versus negative subjects, and in an independent set of T-cells assayed in patients with RA.Results: We measured methylation in blood samples from 137 subjects, 63, 66 and 8 of which were ACPA positive, ACPA negative, and self-report RA, respectively. We identified 1,252 DMRs by considering dose-dependent effects where half (614) of them are underlined genetic effects. These DMRs are enriched in exon, intergenic CpG islands (CGI) and CGI shore regions as well as enhancer-like regions of several blood cell sub-types. Furthermore, the genes associated with these DMRs were enriched in pathways related to immune response such as osteoclast differentiation and MAPK signaling pathway. In addition, 42 (30%) of 142 RA-specific DMRs were well replicated in T-cells cohort.Conclusions: Our results highlight the advantages of sequencing-based high-resolution methylome mapping to reveal biological relevant DNA methylation changes in ACPA positive and negative subjects as well as RA patients."

Higher HER2 copy number in progression than baseline and high frequent PIK3CA mutations were observed in most patients with innate resistance but not acquired resistance. ERBB2/4 was the most mutated gene accounting for trastuzumab resistance, and patients with PIK3CA/R1/C3 or ERBB2/4 mutations at baseline plasma have a significantly worse PFS. Besides, NF1 was found to contribute to trastuzumab resistance and further confirmed by in vitro and in vivo studies, while combined HER2 and MEK/ERK blockade may overcome the resistance.

Along with corroborating known PBC-associated loci (TNFSF15, HLA-DRA), risk haplotypes may potentially model cis-interactions that regulate gene expression. For example, one replicated haplotype association (9q32-9q33.1, OR=1.7, P=3.0x10-21) consists of intergenic SNPs outside of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region that overlap regulatory histone mark peaks in liver and blood cells, and are significantly associated with TNFSF8 expression in whole blood.

The second most common is a surprisingly stable coexistence, over vast areas, of clones with different changes in chromosome numbers. This is contrasted by a third, less frequent, pattern where a novel clone harboring driver mutations or structural chromosome rearrangements completely replaces its progenitor.

The project aims to discover whether and to what extent the behaviour of the immune system is genetically regulated and to detect the relationships of diverse immune cells with autoimmunity. The project consists of the genetic analysis using up to ~8.2 Million variants, deriving from high density genotyping data and low pass whole genome sequencing, and quantitative levels of 95 cell types encompassing 272 immune traits, in a cohort of 1,629 individuals from four clustered Sardinian villages belonging to the SardiNIA/ProgeNIA study."

EGAS00001002273,genetic heterogeneity   familial gastric neuroendocrine tumors,"Gastric neuroendocrine tumors (gNETs) occur with an estimated frequency of 2 per 100,000 in the general population.  Type I gastric neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) represent the 75% of gNTEs and arise from gastric enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells.  They have late age of onset and usually benigh course.  Classically, hypergastrinemia in patients who have autoimmune atrophic gastritis, causes hyperplasia of gastric ECL cells that progresses into type I gastric NETs and parietal cell (PC) destruction.  The genetic bases in families with this disease are unknown.
We performed an exome sequencing study of an atypical aggressive familial gNETs case (with early age onset, nodal infiltrations and gastric adenocarcinomas) that followed a recessive model.  We identified a deleterious mutation in homozygosis in the ATP4A gene, which encodes the proton pump responsible for acid secretion by gastric parietal cells.  This mutation lead to achlorhydria first, and hypergastrinemia and gNET developing as consequence (Calvete et al. 2014).  Recently, two more families with gNETs, classical clinical traits and recessive model have been studies by WES but we didn't find any mutation in the ATP4a gene.  However, putative mutations affecting genes that contribute to the development and the integrity of PC have been found suggesting that genetic alterations associated to this disorder target to a unique cell type (parietal cells).
In order to cinfirm this hypothesis, it is necessary the search for new genes implicated in the gNETs, more familial cases are needed to be studied.  We have identified four more new familial gNETs cases.  Here, we propose their study by WES.  The first family is formed by thress siblings with gNETs.  The other families include two siblings with gNETs.

EGAS00001002978, systems biology approach  understand immunity  pathogenesis  malaria  children exposed  endemic plasmodium falciparum transmission,"From long-term studies of children in Kenya, we know that some children have numerous malaria episodes through to older age, while other children become immune more rapidly. Our hypothesis is that these children with frequent malaria episodes are caught in a vicious circle, whereby malaria episodes lead to impaired immunity to malaria, which in turn leads to further episodes of malaria. We will therefore investigate immune responses in children with different life histories of malaria episodes. We will also include a group of children living in similar environmental conditions but who are completely unexposed to malaria.  Aims: Using RNAseq we will characterise the transcriptome of a group of children with frequent and febrile malaria or infrequent/asymptomatic. These data will be combined with cytokine profiling data (NIMR) and used to build predictive models (Exeter). The predictions will be validated against a similar second group. A single snap shot of immune responses may represent only the endpoint of many immune processes and may not reflect those that are causally related to differences in malaria outcome. Therefore, we will collect and store samples from a larger group of children who will then be followed up for over 3-4 years. This extended follow up will allow us to identify the same groups as described above, and then examine samples taken before the development of those outcomes.

High-resolution copy number analysis of 125 tumors of which 24 were subjected to whole-exome sequencing identified 135 homozygous deletions and 994 somatic gene mutations with predicted functional consequences. We identified new recurrent alterations in 4 genes (ARID1A, RPS6KA3, NFE2L2 and IRF2) not previously described in HCC. Functional analyses demonstrated tumor suppressor properties for IRF2 whose inactivation, exclusively found in hepatitis B virus related tumors, leads to impaired TP53 function. Alternatively, inactivation of proteins involved in chromatin remodeling was frequent and predominant in alcohol related tumors. Moreover, activation of the oxidative stress metabolism and inactivation of RPS6KA3 were new pathways associated with WNT/beta-catenin activation, thereby suggesting a cooperative effect in tumorigenesis. This study shows the dramatic somatic genetic diversity in HCC, it reveals interactions between oncogene and tumor suppressor gene mutations markedly related to specific risk factors."

especially when trying to identify smaller effects. One way to address this issue is to

Parallel single cell RNA-Seq and bisulfite sequencing exploits that individual cells are tagged and hence each cell canbe reliably assigned to the donor of origin based on the genetic variants it contains. In addition, analyzing the genetic signature of single cells within a differentiating population can reveal differentation stages that are not easily detected in bulk RNAseq data. Studying the transcriptome (RNA-seq) and DNA methylation (bisulfite-seq) from the same cell allows detailed comparison of expression and epigenetic effects."

We developed an automated confocal microscopy-based live cell assay (DeathPro) that robustly de-convolves cell death and proliferation over time by employing a specific image processing strategy. Using DeathPro, we screened nine OC patient-derived cell lines and one normal cell line (HOSEpiC) with 22 drugs or combinations. Whole genome was performed to analyze if the cell lines harbor OC-typical genomic aberrations and to relate genomic features to drug sensitivities. Commonly observed alterations in OC patients like TP53 mutations and MYC or PI3KCA amplifications were absent in the normal cell line but frequently detected in the OC cell lines. Moreover, genome-derived homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) scores of the OC cell lines correlated with their responses to carboplatin, olaparib and DNA demethylation drugs. Overall, we propose an imaging-based platform to guide drug development and genome-drug sensitivity analysis."

Through sequencing of 79 spatially distinct regions from 16 early stage tumors, we show that despite low mutation burdens, EGFR-mutant Asian LUADs unexpectedly exhibit a complex genomic landscape with frequent and early whole genome doubling, aneuploidy and high clonal diversity. Multiple truncal alterations, including TP53 mutations and loss of CDKN2A and RB1, converge on cell cycle dysregulation, with late sector-specific high amplitude amplifications and deletions that potentially beget drug resistant clones. We highlight the association between genomic architecture and clinical phenotypes, such as co-occurring truncal drivers and primary TKI resistance. Through comparative analysis with published smoking-related LUAD, we postulate that the high intra-tumor heterogeneity observed in Asian EGFR-mutant LUAD may be contributed by an early dominant driver, genomic instability and low background mutation rates."

GBM can be subcategorized into four distinct subtypes; tumors that shift towards the mesenchymal phenotype upon recurrence are generally associated with treatment resistance, unfavorable prognosis, and the infiltration of pro-tumorigenic macrophages.
Results: We explore the transcriptional regulatory networks of mesenchymal-associated tumor-associated macrophages (MA-TAMs), which drive the malignant phenotypic state of GBM, and identify macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) as the most highly differentially expressed gene. MARCOhigh TAMs induce a phenotypic shift towards mesenchymal cellular state of glioma stem cells, promoting both invasive and proliferative activities, as well as therapeutic resistance to irradiation. MARCOhigh TAMs also significantly accelerate tumor engraftment and growth in vivo. Moreover, both MA-TAM master regulators and their target genes are significantly correlated with poor clinical outcomes, and are often associated with genomic aberrations in neurofibromin 1 (NF1) and phosphoinositide 3-kinases/mammalian target of rapamycin/Akt pathway (PI3K-mTOR-AKT)-related genes. We further demonstrate origination of MA-TAMs from peripheral blood, as well as their potential association
with tumor-induced polarization states and immunosuppressive environments.
Conclusions: Collectively, our study characterizes the global transcriptional profile of TAMs driving mesenchymal GBM pathogenesis, providing potential therapeutic targets for improving the effectiveness of GBM immunotherapy."

This arrhythmia affects women twice as frequently as men, and is often diagnosed in patients below 40 years of age. Familial clustering, early onset of symptoms, and lack of structural anomaly indicate involvement of genetic factors in AVNRT pathophysiology. We hypothesized that AVNRT patients have a high prevalence of variants in genes that are highly expressed in the atrioventricular conduction axis of the heart and potentially involved in arrhythmic diseases. Next-generation sequencing of 67 genes was applied to the DNA profile of 298 AVNRT patients and 10 AVNRT family members using HaloPlex Target Enrichment System.In total, we identified 229 variants in 60 genes; 215 missenses, four frame shifts, four codon deletions, three missense and splice sites, two stop-gain variants, and one start-lost variant. Sixty-five of these were not present in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database. Furthermore, we report two AVNRT families with co-segregating variants.

We are sequencing ELGH samples as the main cohort for the Autozygosity project, to find rare homozygous functional variants in healthy humans. This application is to genotype a random sample of 480 ELGH recruits on the Illumina Multi-ethnic Global 8 array.  
Currently we are only sequencing the ~20% of recruits who report that their parents are related. Amongst the first 535 samples, mean autozygosity is 4.5%, and 43% of samples have &gt;5% autozygosity, similar to that expected from first cousin marriage (6.25%). Recently we analysed genotype data from the Born in Bradford (BiB) cohort, which formed the core of our previous autozygosity sequencing (Narasimhan et al., Science, 2016), and discovered that in the BiB people who had not reported parental relatedness, another 22% (443/2049) actually had over 5% autozygosity. We therefore want to characterise more fully the distribution of autozygosity amongst the ELGH participants. So far, ~12,000 have been collected, but we estimate that 480 will give us a good assessment of the distribution of autozygosity amongst people in the cohort that we can correlate with information provided at recruitment on self- reported parental relatedness, ethnicity, age etc. This will both allow us to optimise our sequencing strategy, and also act as preliminary data to support applications for funds to genotype or low-coverage sequence (RD's preferred option) everyone in the cohort. We will also include some people we are sequencing anyway, which will allow us to evaluate imputation performance on exome regions.

Here we report the identification of mutations in TRAIP, encoding an E3 RING ubiquitin ligase, in patients with microcephalic primordial dwarfism/Seckel syndrome. We establish that TRAIP relocalizes to sites of DNA damage where it is required for optimal phosphorylation of H2AX and RPA2 during S-phase in response to UV irradiation, as well as fork progression through UV-induced DNA lesions. TRAIP is necessary for efficient cell cycle progression and mutations in TRAIP therefore limit cellular proliferation, providing a potential mechanism for microcephaly and dwarfism phenotypes. Human genetics thus identifies TRAIP as a novel component of the DNA damage response to replication-blocking DNA lesions."
EGAS00001000283,rna seq  patients  primordial dwarfism,"Transcriptome studies in patients with rare genetic diseases can potentially aid in theinterpretation of likely causal genetic variation through identification of altered transcriptabundance and/or structure. RNA-Seq is the most sensitive assay for both investigatingtranscript structure and abundanceThe primary aim of this pilot project is to investigate to what degree integrating exome-Seqand RNA-Seq data on the same individual can accelerate the identification of causal allelesfor rare genetic diseases. There are two main strands to this: (i) identifying which variantsdiscovered in exome-seq appear to be having a functional impact on transcripts, and (ii)identifying transcript outliers, especially among known causal genes, that may not necessarilyhave a causal variant identified from exome sequencing. The latter may identify the presenceof causal variants that lie far from coding regions (e.g. the formation of cryptic splice sitesdeep within introns, or loss of long range regulatory elements), which can be confirmed withfurther targeted genetic assays. Just over 50% of all disease-causing variants recorded in theHuman Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) affect transcript structure and abundance (e.g.nonsense SNVs, essential splice site SNVs, frameshifting indels, CNVs).This pilot project will study RNA from lymphoblastoid cell-lines from 12 patients withprimordial dwarfism syndromes, for 10 of these samples we have previously generate exomedata as part of our collaboration with the group of Prof Andrew Jackson. The two remainingsamples are positive controls where the causal mutation is known, and is known to affecttranscript structure and/or abundance.Primordial dwarfism is a prime candidate for these RNA-seq studies because all knowncausal mutations to date have key roles in DNA replication and thus, unsurprisingly, theproducts of the causal genes are typically ubiquitously expressed.Each RNA will be sequenced, with two technical replicates (independent RT-PCR and libraries) persample, and each replicate run in 1/2 of a HiSeq lane using 100bp paired reads. Samples preparation was as follows :The cells were grown to confluency, then pellets frozen at -80.

We had previously genotyped a subset of the Aboriginal individuals (70/72) using the Illumina Omni2.5 BeadChip platform and found 99% concordance at overlapping sites, which suggests high quality genotyping. Finally, we compared our SNVs to six publicly available variant databases, such as dbSNP and the Exome Sequencing Project, and 70,115 of our SNVs did not overlap any of the single nucleotide polymorphic sites in all the databases. Our data set provides a useful reference point for genomic studies on Aboriginal Australians."
EGAS00001002163,kdm5b methlyation,"In the DDD project we have discovered a gene, KDM5B, that is significantly enriched for both de novo loss-of-function (LoF), de novo missense and biallelic LoF mutations in the DDD 8K, and de novo LoF mutations have previously been reported in autism and intellectual disability patients. There are also patients in DDD with inherited LoFs in KDM5B, and we observe significant over-transmission. We suspect that there are modifiers of KDM5B LoFs in the patients with de novo mutations, such that it fits a “two-hit” model, or perhaps making KDM5B mutations effectively recessive.

EGAS00001001601,malignant pheochromocytomas paragangliomas harbor mutations  transport  cell adhesion genes,"One out of ten patients with pheochromocytoma (PCC) and paraganglioma (PGL) develop malignant disease. Today there are no reliable pathological methods to predict malignancy at the time of diagnosis. Tumors harboring mutations in the succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) gene often metastasize but the sequential genetic events resulting in malignant progression are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to identify somatic mutations that contribute to the malignant transformation of PCC/PGL. We performed pair-wise (tumor-normal) whole-exome sequencing to analyze the somatic mutational landscape in five malignant and four benign primary PCC/sympathetic PGL (sPGL), including two biological replicates from each specimen. In total, 225 unique somatic mutations were identified in 215 genes, with an average mutation rate of 0.54 mutations/megabase. Malignant tumors had a significantly higher number of mutations compared to benign tumors (p&lt;0.001). Three novel genes were identified as recurrently mutated; MYCN, MYO5B and VCL, and mutations in these genes were exclusively found in malignant sPGL tumors. Mutations in the MYO5B gene could be verified in two publicly available data sets. A gene ontology analysis of mutated genes showed enrichment of cellular functions related to cytoskeletal protein binding, myosin complex, and motor activity, many of which had functions in Rab and Rac/Rho GTPase pathways. Conclusively, we have identified recurrent mutations in genes related to intracellular transport and cell adhesion, and we have confirmed recurrent mutations of MYO5B in PCC/PGL cases with malignant potential. Our study suggests that deregulated Rab and Rac/Rho pathways may be important in PCC/PGL tumorigenesis."

To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the malignant progression of low-grade Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutant gliomas, we studied paired tumor samples from 41 patients, comparing higher-grade, progressed samples to their lower-grade counterparts. Integrated genomic analyses, including whole-exome sequencing, copy number, gene expression and DNA methylation profiling, demonstrated non-linear clonal expansion of the original tumors and identified oncogenic pathways driving progression. These include activation of the MYC and RTK-RAS-PI3K pathways, up-regulation of the FOXM1- and E2F2-mediated cell cycle transition genes, as well as epigenetic silencing of developmental transcriptional factors bound by Polycomb repressive complex 2 in human embryonic stem cells. Our results not only provide mechanistic insight into the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms driving glioma progression but also identify inhibition of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family as a potential therapeutic approach."

EGAS00001001612,exome sequencing  uterine leiomyosarcomas,"Uterine leiomyosarcomas (ULMSs) are aggressive smooth muscle tumors associated with poor clinical outcome. Despite previous cytogenetic and molecular studies, their molecular background has remained elusive. To examine somatic variation in ULMS, we performed exome sequencing on 19 tumors. Altogether 43 genes were mutated in at least two ULMSs. Most frequently mutated genes included tumor protein P53 (TP53; 6/19; 33%), alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX; 5/19; 26%), and mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12; 4/19; 21%). Unlike ATRX mutations, both TP53 and MED12 alterations have repeatedly been associated with ULMSs. All the observed ATRX alterations were either nonsense or frameshift mutations. ATRX protein levels were reliably analyzed by immunohistochemistry in altogether 44 ULMSs, and the majority of tumors (23/44; 52%) showed clearly reduced expression. Loss of ATRX expression has been associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), and thus the telomere length was analyzed with telomere-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization. The ALT phenotype was confirmed in all ULMSs showing diminished ATRX expression. Exome data also revealed one nonsense mutation in death-domain associated protein (DAXX), another gene previously associated with ALT, and the tumor showed ALT positivity. Aberrant expression of both TP53 and ATRX were associated with poor overall survival. In conclusion, exome sequencing revealed that TP53, ATRX, and MED12 are frequently mutated in ULMSs. ALT phenotype was commonly seen in tumors, indicating that ATR inhibitors, which were recently suggested as possible new drugs for ATRX-deficient tumors, could provide a potential novel therapeutic option for ULMS."

We report the transgenerational transmission of a constitutional epimutation inthe cblC class of inborn error of vitamin B12 metabolism that we named epi-cblC. Subjectscarry, in trans, a heterozygous MMACHC mutation and a promoter epimutation, detectable inblood, fibroblasts and sperm; the epimutation was transmitted through three generations. 5-Azacytidine restored the MMACHC expression in fibroblasts. MMACHC is flanked byCCDC163P and PRDX1, which are in the opposite orientation. Genome-wide sequencingidentified PRDX1 mutations that forced antisense transcription of MMACHC, resulting in aH3K36me3 mark in the promoter. The silencing of PRDX1 transcription produced a partialhypomethylation of the epiallele and restored the expression of MMCHC. The example of epicblC shows the need to look for compound epigenetic/genetic heterozygosity in patients with typical disease manifestation and genetic heterozygosity in disease-causing genes located in other gene trios."
EGAS00001001645,exome wide association analysis  coronary artery disease   kingdom  saudi arabia population,"Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Mortality rates associated with CAD have shown an exceptional increase particularly in fast developing economies like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Over the past twenty years, CAD has become the leading cause of death in KSA and has reached epidemic proportions. This rise is undoubtedly caused by fast urbanization that is associated with a life-style that promotes CAD. However, the question remains whether genetics play a significant role and whether genetic susceptibility is increased in KSA compared to the well-studied Western European populations. Therefore, we performed an Exome-wide association study (EWAS) in 832 patients and 1,076 controls of Saudi Arabian origin to test whether population specific, strong genetic risk factors for CAD exist, or whether the polygenic risk score for known genetic risk factors for CAD, lipids, and Type 2 Diabetes show evidence for an enriched genetic burden. Our results do not show significant associations for a single genetic locus. However, the heritability estimate for CAD for this population was high (h2 = 0.53, S.E. = 0.1, p = 4e-12) and we observed a significant association of the polygenic risk score for CAD that demonstrates that the population of KSA, at least in part, shares the genetic risk associated to CAD in Western populations."
EGAS00001001659,integrated clinical  genome  transcriptome analysis  multisampled lethal metastatic prostate cancer,"We report the first combined analysis of whole genome sequence, detailed clinical history, and transcriptome sequence of multiple prostate cancer metastases in a single patient (A21).  Whole genome and transcriptome sequence was obtained from 9 anatomically separate metastases, and targeted DNA sequencing was performed in cancerous and noncancerous foci within the primary tumor specimen removed 5 years prior to death. Transcriptome analysis revealed increased expression of AR-regulated genes in liver metastases that harbored an AR p.L702H mutation, suggesting a dominant effect by the mutation despite being present in only 1 of an estimated 16 copies per cell. The metastases harbored several alterations to the PI3K/AKT pathway, including a clonal truncal mutation in PIK3CG and present in all metastatic sites studied.  The list of truncal genomic alterations shared by all metastases included homozygous deletion of TP53, hemizygous deletion of RB1 and CHD1, and amplification of FGFR1. If the patient were treated today given this knowledge, use of second-generation androgen-directed therapies, cessation of glucocorticoid administration, and therapeutic inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway or FGFR1 receptor could provide personalized benefit. Three previously unreported truncal clonal missense mutations (ABCC4 p.R891L, ALDH9A1 p.W89R, and ASNA1 p.P75R) were expressed at the RNA level and assessed as druggable. The truncal status of mutations is critical for actionability, and can only be determined through analysis of multiple sites of metastasis. Our findings suggest that a large set of deeply analyzed cases could serve as powerful guide to more effective prostate cancer basic science and personalized cancer medicine clinical trials."
EGAS00001001690, exome sequencing  primary retinoblastoma tissues  matching lymphocyte dna,"Retinoblastoma is a rare childhood cancer initiated by RB1 mutation or MYCN amplification, while additional alterations may be required for tumor development. However, the view on single nucleotide variants is very limited. To better understand oncogenesis, we determined the genomic landscape of retinoblastoma.  We performed exome sequencing of 71 retinoblastomas and matched blood DNA. Next, we determined the presence of single nucleotide variants, copy number alterations and viruses.   Aside from RB1, recurrent gene mutations were very rare. Only a limited fraction of tumors showed BCOR (7/71, 10%) or CREBBP alterations (3/71, 4%). No evidence was found for the presence of viruses. Instead, specific somatic copy number alterations were more common, particularly in patients diagnosed at later age. Recurrent alterations of chromosomal arms often involved less than one copy, also in highly pure tumor samples, suggesting within-tumor heterogeneity.  Our results show that retinoblastoma is among the least mutated cancers and signify the extreme sensitivity of the childhood retina for RB1 loss. We hypothesize that retinoblastomas arising later in retinal development benefit more from subclonal secondary alterations and therefore, these alterations are more selected for in these tumors. Targeted therapy based on these subclonal events might be insufficient for complete tumor control."

BCC is primarily driven by the aberrant activation of the Sonic Hedgehog (Hh) pathway. However, its extensive phenotypical variation remains to be explained. The genetic profiling of 293 BCCs revealed the highest mutation rate observed in cancer (65 Mutations/Mb), with strong prevalence of UV-light signature mutations. 85% of BCCs harbored mutations in Hh pathway genes: mutually exclusive PTCH1 (73%) and SMO (20%) (P=6.6x10-8), SUFU (8%), and in TP53 (61%). 85% of BCCs also harbored secondary driver mutations in other genes implicated in BCC tumorigenesis. Recurrent secondary driver mutations were observed in MYCN (30%), PPP6C (15%), STK19 (10%), LATS1 (8%), ERBB2 (4%), PIK3CA (2%), RAC1 (1%) and N/K/H-RAS (2%). Loss of function (LoF) and deleterious missense mutations were observed in PTPN14 (23%), RB1 (8%) and FBXW7 (5%). In line with the mutational profiles detected by RNAseq, we observed activation of the Hh pathway as well as upregulation of target genes of the Hippo-YAP pathway and activation of MYCN target genes. The functional analysis of the novel tumorigenic driver mutations in MYCN, PTPN14 and LATS1 demonstrates their relevance in BCC tumorigenesis and provides an expanded molecular understanding of BCC."
EGAS00001001714,wes analysis   mixed cohort  pituitary tumors,"BACKGROUND:  Sporadic pituitary adenomas are the second most common primary brain tumor, but their genetics remains incompletely understood. We performed deep DNA sequencing of 42 pituitary macroadenomas, including hormonally active and atypical adenomas.   METHODS:  Pituitary adenomas representative of a spectrum of histopathologic subtypes, primary and recurrent tumors, and MIB-1 proliferative indices were profiled. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on tumors and paired blood followed by analysis of somatic copy number alteration and mutation.   RESULTS:  On the whole, the tumors harbored a low rate of mutations, similar to other benign brain tumors. However, almost one-third (29%) exhibited somatic copy-number alterations across large fractions of the genome (up to 99%). Despite such widespread genomic disruption, these tumors had few focal events, which is atypical among highly-disrupted cancers. The other 71% of tumors formed a distinct molecular class, with somatic copy-number alterations involving less than 6% of the genome. Among the highly-disrupted group, 92% were functional or atypical null-cell adenomas, whereas 87% of the less-disrupted group were clinically non-functional adenomas. The only significantly recurrent events were arm-level losses of chromosomes 1, 2, 11, and 18. No significantly recurrent mutations or insertion/deletion events were identified, suggesting no genes are altered by exomic mutations in &gt;15% of pituitary tumors.  CONCLUSIONS:  Genomic characterization of a large series of sporadic pituitary adenomas reveals two classes of tumor, based on genomic disruption from arm-level copy-number alterations, which associate with hormonal and histologic subtypes."
EGAS00001002684,characterization  genetic intratumor heterogeneity  colorectal cancer  matching patient derived spheroid cultures,"Patient-derived in vitro cultures of colorectal cancer (CRC) may help guide treatment strategies prior to patient treatment. However, most previous studies have been performed on a single biopsy per tumor. The purpose of this study was to analyze multiple spatially distinct biopsies from CRCs and see how well intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) was recapitulated in matching patient-derived spheroids. Three to five biopsies were collected from six CRC tumors. Each biopsy was split in two; one half was used for spheroid culturing, the other half was used for direct DNA and RNA purification. For two of the patients, lymph node metastases were analyzed. Somatic mutations were called from whole exome sequencing data. Each tumor contained multiple mutations shared across all biopsies and spheroids, including major CRC drivers such as APC, KRAS, and TP53. At the same time, all tumors exhibited ITH on both mutation and copy number level. The concordance between biopsies and spheroids ranged between 40-70% for coding mutations. For three of the patients the biopsy and spheroid from matching areas clustered together, meaning that the spheroid resembled the area of origin more than the other areas. However, all biopsies and spheroids contained private mutations. Thereby, multiple cultures from spatially distinct sites of the tumor increase the insight into the genetic profile of the entire tumor. RNA sequencing based molecular subtyping was stable and seemed independent of genetic ITH. In conclusion, all examined CRC tumors contained genetic ITH on mutation and copy number level. Spheroid cultures partly reflected this ITH, meaning that multiple cultures from distinct sites of the tumor improved the representation of the different genetic subclones in the primary tumor. This should be taken in to account when establishing patient-derived models for drug screening."

EGAS00001001665,rare snps  receptor tyrosine kinases  negative outcome predictors  multiple myeloma,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell disorder that is characterized by a great genetic heterogeneity. Recent next generation sequencing studies revealed an accumulation of tumor-associated mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) which may also contribute to the activation of survival pathways in MM. To investigate the clinical role of RTK-mutations in MM, we deep-sequenced the coding DNA-sequence of EGFR, EPHA2, ERBB3, IGF1R, NTRK1 and NTRK2 which were previously found to be mutated in MM, in 75 uniformly treated MM patients of the ""Deutsche Studiengruppe Multiples Myelom"". Subsequently, we correlated the detected mutations with common cytogenetic alterations and clinical parameters. We identified 11 novel non-synonymous SNVs or rare patient-specific SNPs, not listed in the SNP databases 1000 genomes and dbSNP, in 10 primary MM cases. The mutations predominantly affected the tyrosine-kinase and ligand-binding domains and no correlation with cytogenetic parameters was found. Interestingly, however, patients with RTK-mutations, specifically those with rare patient-specific SNPs, showed a significant lower overall, event-free and progression-free survival. This indicates that RTK SNVs and rare patient-specific RTK SNPs are of prognostic relevance and suggests that MM patients with RTK-mutations could potentially profit from treatment with RTK-inhibitors."

EGAS00001001715,copy number profiling  primary samples  cell lines  retinoblastoma,"While RB1 loss initiates retinoblastoma development, additional somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) can drive tumor progression. Although SCNAs have been identified with good concordance between studies at a cytoband resolution, accurate identification of single genes for all recurrent SCNAs is still challenging. This study presents a comprehensive meta-analysis of genome-wide SCNAs integrated with gene expression profiling data, narrowing down the list of plausible retinoblastoma driver genes. We performed SCNA profiling of 45 primary retinoblastoma samples and 8 retinoblastoma cell lines by high-resolution microarrays. We combined our data with genomic, clinical and histopathological data of ten published genome-wide SCNA studies, which strongly enhanced the power of our analyses (N=310). Comprehensive recurrence analysis of SCNAs in all studies integrated with gene expression data allowed us to reduce candidate gene lists for 1q, 2p, 6p, 7q and 13q to a limited gene set. Besides the well-established driver genes RB1 (13q-loss) and MYCN (2p-gain) we identified CRB1 and NEK7 (1q-gain), SOX4 (6p-gain) and NUP205 (7q-gain) as novel retinoblastoma driver candidates. Depending on the sample subset and algorithms used, alternative candidates were identified including MIR181 (1q-gain) and DEK (6p gain). Remarkably, our study showed that copy number gains rarely exceeded change of one copy, even in pure tumor samples with 100% homozygosity at the RB1 locus (N=34), which is indicative for intra-tumor heterogeneity. In addition, profound between-tumor variability was observed that was associated with age at diagnosis and differentiation grades. Since focal alterations at commonly altered chromosome regions were rare except for 2p24.3 (MYCN), further functional validation of the oncogenic potential of the described candidate genes is now required. For further investigations, our study provides a refined and revised set of candidate retinoblastoma driver genes."

EGAS00001001668,c14orf93 rtfc  identified   novel regulator  familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer  thyroid function,"The genetic causes for familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC) remain largely unknown. Through genetic linkage analysis and exome sequencing, C14orf93 (RTFC) was identified as a novel susceptibility gene in a FNMTC family. RTFC promotes thyroid cancer cell survival under starving conditions, and thyroid cancer cell migration. The FNMTC-linked V205M RTFC mutant enhances the colony forming capacity of thyroid cancer cells. Moreover, knockout of Rtfc compromises the in vitro thyroid differentiation of mouse ESCs. Rtfc-/- mice are viable and fertile, and the size and the morphology of thyroid are not affected by Rtfc knockout. However, female Rtfc-/- mice, but not male Rtfc-/- mice, display hypothyroidism. In summary, our data suggest the roles of RTFC in thyroid carcinogenesis, in vitro differentiation of thyroid cells, and in vivo thyroid function."

While confirming the presence of previously recognized major ancestry components in the Southeast Asian population structure, we highlight the Kankanaey Igorots from the highlands of the Philippine Mountain Province as likely the closest living representatives of the source population that may have given rise to the Austronesianexpansion. This conclusion rests on independent evidence from various analyses of autosomal data and uniparental markers. Given the extensive presence of trade goods, cultural and linguistic evidence of Indian influence in Southeast Asia starting from 2.5kya we also detect traces of a South Asian signature in different populations in the region dating to the last couple of thousand years."

We identify 19 new TGCT risk loci, approximately doubling the number of known TGCT risk loci to 44. By performing in-situ Hi-C in TGCT cells, we establish a network of physical interactions between all 44 TGCT risk SNPs and candidate causal genes. Our findings reveal widespread disruption of developmental transcriptional regulators as a basis of disease susceptibility, consistent with failed primordial germ cell differentiation as an initiating step in TGCT oncogenesis1. Defective microtubule assembly and dysregulation of KIT-MAPK signalling also feature as recurrently disrupted pathways. Our findings support a polygenic model of disease risk and provide insight into the biological basis of TGCT."

EGAS00001000132, clonal  mutational evolution spectrum  primary triple negative breast cancers,"Primary triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) represent approximately 16% of all breast cancers and are a tumour type defined by exclusion,for which comprehensive landscapes of somatic mutation have not been determined. Here we show in 104 early TNBC cases, that at the time of diagnosis these cancers exhibit a wide and continuous spectrum of genomic evolution, with some exhibiting only a handful of somatic aberrations in a few pathways, whereas others contain hundreds of somatic events and multiple pathways implicated. Integration with matched whole transcriptome sequence data revealed that only 36% of mutations are expressed.  By examining single nucleotide variant (SNV) allelic abundance derived from deep re-sequencing (median &gt; 20,000 fold) measurements in 2414 somatic mutations, we determine for the first time in an epithelial tumour, the relative abundance of clonal genotypes among cases in the population. We show that TNBC vary widely and continuously in their clonal frequencies at the time of diagnosis, with basal subtype TNBC exhibiting more variation than non-basal TNBC. Although p53 and  somatic mutations appear clonally dominant compared with other pathways, in some tumours their clonal frequencies are incompatible with founder status. Mutations in cytoskeletal and cell shape/motility proteins occurred at lower clonal frequencies, suggesting they occurred later during tumour progression.  Taken together our results show that future attempts to dissect the biology and therapeutic responses of TNBC will require the determination of individual tumour clonal genotypes."

We here performed Exome-Seq of 15 pancreatic tumor-normal pairs. We captured 162,073 exons of 16,954 genes and sequenced the targeted regions to a mean coverage of 56 folds. This study identified a total of 1,517 somatic mutations and validated 934 of them by transcriptome sequencing. We detected recurrent mutations in 56 genes. Among them, 41 have not been described. The mutation rates varied widely among tumors. The diversity of mutation rates was significantly correlated with the distinct MLH1 copy-number status. Exome-Seq revealed intensive genomic instability in a tumor with MLH1 homozygous deletion, indicated by a dramatically elevated mutation rate of somatic substitutions, small insertions/deletions (indels), as well as indels presented at microsatellites. Notably, we detected MLH1 allelic loss in 4 tumors. MLH1 expression was decreased by nearly half in these cases. While they were negative in the conventional microsatellite instability assay, they showed a 10.5-fold increase in the mutation rate of somatic indels, e.g. truncating indels in TP53 and TGFBR2, indicating MLH1 haploinsufficiency in correction of DNA indel errors. We further analyzed the exomes of 15 renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) and confirmed MLH1 haploinsufficiency. We observed a significant increase in the mutation rate of somatic indels in affected cases and identified recurrent truncating indels in several cancer genes such as VHL, PBRM1 and JARID1C. Together, our data suggest that MLH1 hemizygous deletion, through increasing the mutation rate of somatic indels, could drive the development and progression of sporadic cancers."

Here, we perform a joint investigation in Central African hunter-gatherers and farmers of adult standing height, sitting height, leg length, and body mass index (BMI), considering 358 hunter-gatherers and 169 farmers with genotypes for 153,798 SNPs. In addition to reduced standing heights, hunter-gatherers have shorter sitting heights and leg lengths and higher sitting/standing height ratios than farmers and lower BMI for males. Standing height, sitting height, and leg length are strongly correlated with inferred levels of farmer genetic ancestry, whereas BMI is only weakly correlated, perhaps reflecting greater contributions of non-genetic factors to body weight than to height. Single- and multi-marker association tests identify one region and eight genes associated with hunter-gatherer/farmer status, and 24 genes associated with the height-related traits. Many of these genes have putative functions consistent with roles in determining their associated traits and the pygmy phenotype, and they include three associated with standing height in non-Africans (PRKG1, DSCAM, MAGI2). We find evidence that European height-associated SNPs or variants in linkage disequilibrium with them contribute to standing- and sitting-height determination in Central Africans, but not to the differential status of hunter-gatherers and farmers. These findings provide new insights into the biological basis of the pygmy phenotype, and they highlight the potential of cross-population studies for exploring the genetic basis of phenotypes that vary naturally across populations.

We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of plasma DNA and identified two discrete regions at transcription start sites (TSS) where the nucleosome occupancy results in different read-depth coverage patterns in expressed and silent genes. By employing machine learning for gene classification we found that the plasma DNA read depth patterns from healthy donors reflected the expression signature of hematopoietic cells. In cancer patients with metastatic disease, we were able to classify expressed cancer driver genes in regions with somatic copy number gains with high accuracy. We could even determine the expressed isoform of genes with several TSSs as confirmed by RNA-Seq of the matching primary tumor.

We profiled mRNA expression at six stages of an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model of endocrine pancreas development from two donors, and characterized the distinct transcriptomic profiles associated with each stage. Established regulators of endodermal lineage commitment, such as SOX17 (log2 fold change [FC] compared to iPSCs=14.2, p-value=4.9x10-5) and the pancreatic agenesis gene GATA6 (log2 FC=12.1, p-value=8.6x10-5), showed transcriptional variation consistent with their known developmental roles. However, these analyses highlighted many other genes with stage-specific expression patterns, some of which may be novel drivers or markers of islet development. For example, the leptin receptor gene, LEPR, was most highly expressed in published data from in vivo-matured cells compared to our endocrine pancreas-like cells (log2 FC=5.5, p-value=2.0x10-12), suggesting a role for the leptin pathway in the maturation process. Endocrine pancreas-like cells showed significant stage-selective expression of adult islet genes, including INS, ABCC8, and GLP1R, and enrichment of relevant GO-terms (e.g. ""insulin secretion""; odds ratio=4.2, p-value=1.9x10-3): however, principal component analysis indicated that in vitro-differentiated cells were more immature than adult islets. Integration of the stage-specific expression information with genetic data from T2D genome-wide association studies revealed that 46 of 82 T2D-associated loci harbor genes present in at least one developmental stage, facilitating refinement of potential effector transcripts. Together, these data show that expression profiling in an iPSC islet development model can further understanding of islet biology and T2D pathogenesis."

Cell cycle progression increased with sequential inactivation of tumour suppressors, yet remained higher in metastases, perhaps driven by cell cycle regulatory gene missenses. Half of the cases were hypoxic by expression markers, overlapping with molecular subtypes. Paired tumour heterogeneity showed truncations, inversions and translocations are conserved and therefore likely driver events. Multiple PDAC arising synchronously and metachronously in the same pancreas were actually intra-parenchymal metastases, not independent primary tumours.

We also investigated the effect of loading the macrophages with modified LDL. We found that many mRNAs and miRNAs were significantly up- or downregulated during differentiation. While there was no correlation between gene expression and DNA methylation changes at transcription start sites, we identified a large number of intra- and intergenic regions that rapidly lost DNA methylation, became nucleosome-free and gained histone marks indicative of active enhancers. Loading of macrophages with modified LDL caused gene expression changes, but no chromatin changes. In summary, our results demonstrate that monocyte to macrophage differentiation is associated with rapid, highly targeted epigenetic changes, whereas lipid uptake mainly affects regulatory circuits of soluble factors."

Retrospective studies of further MS samples, twelve with and four without preceding or concomitant bone marrow AML, revealed NFE2 mutations in two additional cases, both with isolated MS and prior myeloid malignancies.

Prompted by the detection and subsequent therapeutic inhibition of amplified FGFR1 in a patient with metastatic leiomyosarcoma, we investigated the oncogenic properties and potential as drug target of FGFR1 in STS.Experimental Design: The frequency of FGFR1 amplification and overexpression, as assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization and mRNA expression profiling, SNP array profiling, and RNA sequencing, was determined in three independent patient cohorts. The sensitivity of STS cell lines with or without FGFR1 alterations to genetic and pharmacologic FGFR1 inhibition and the signaling pathways engaged by FGFR1 were investigated using short-term viability assays, long-term colony formation assays, and biochemical analysis.Results: Increased FGFR1 copy number was detected in 74 of 190 (38.9%; Cohort 1), 13 of 79 (16.5%; Cohort 2), and 80 of 254 (31.5%; Cohort 3) patients. FGFR1 overexpression occurred in 16 of 79 (20.2%, Cohort 2) and 39 of 254 (15.4%; Cohort 3) patients. Targeting of FGFR1 by short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown and different small-molecule inhibitors (PD173074, AZD4547, BGJ398) revealed that the requirement for FGFR1 signaling in STS cells is primarily dictated by FGFR1 expression levels, and identified the MAPK-ERK1/2 axis as critical FGFR1 effector pathway.Conclusion: These data identify FGFR1 as driver gene in multiple STS subtypes and support FGFR1 inhibition, guided by patient selection according to FGFR1 expression and monitoring of MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling, as therapeutic option in this challenging group of diseases.H021"
EGAS00001001845,mutant kit  imatinib sensitive target  metastatic sinonasal carcinoma h021,"Sinonasal carcinomas (SNCs) comprise various rare tumor types that are characterized by marked histologic diversity and largely unknown molecular profiles, yet share an overall poor prognosis owing to an aggressive clinical course and frequent late-stage diagnosis. The lack of effective systemic therapies for locally advanced or metastatic SNC poses a major challenge to therapeutic decision making for individual patients. Here, we used whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing to identify a KIT exon 11 mutation (c.1733_1735del, p.578_579del) as actionable target in a patient with metastatic SNC whose tumor, despite all diagnostic efforts, could not be assigned to any known SNC category and was refractory to multimodal therapy. Molecularly guided treatment with imatinib resulted in a dramatic and durable response with remission of nearly all tumor manifestations, indicating a dominant driver function of mutant KIT in this tumor. This observation highlights the potential of unbiased genomic profiling for uncovering the vulnerabilities of individual malignancies, particularly in rare and unclassifiable tumors, and underscores that KIT exon 11 mutations represent tractable therapeutic targets across different histologies.H021"

Currently, clinical decision making in patients with CUP primarily relies on histopathology and clinical features. Comprehensive molecular profiling has the potential to contribute to diagnostic categorization and, most importantly, guide CUP therapy through identification of actionable lesions. We here report the case of an advanced-stage malignancy initially mimicking poorly differentiated soft-tissue sarcoma that did not respond to multi-agent chemotherapy. Molecular profiling within a clinical whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing program revealed a heterozygous, highly amplified KRAS G12S mutation, compound-heterozygous TP53 mutation/deletion, high mutational load, and focal amplification of chromosomes 9p (including PDL1 [CD274] and JAK2) and 10p (including GATA3). Integrated analysis of molecular data and conventional histopathology suggested a diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and provided a rationale for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy with pembrolizumab, which resulted in rapid clinical improvement and a lasting partial remission. Analysis of 157 TNBC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed focal, high-level PDL1 amplification coinciding with excessive PDL1 mRNA expression in 24% of cases. Collectively, these results illustrate the diagnostic utility of multidimensional tumor profiling in cases with non-descript histology and immune phenotype, demonstrate the predictive power of genomic PDL1 amplification for immune checkpoint inhibition, and suggest a targeted therapeutic strategy in chromosome 9p24.1/PDL1-amplified cancers.H021"

It can be cured by aggressive surgery and chemotherapy, but outcomes for metastatic or chemoresistant disease remain dismal.  Cancer sequencing studies have shown that the p53 pathway is dysregulated in nearly every case, often by translocation; however, no studies of osteosarcoma evolution or intratumor heterogeneity have been done to date.  We studied a patient with chemoresistant, metastatic disease over the course of three years.  We performed exome sequencing on germline DNA and DNA collected from tumor at three separate timepoints.  We compared variant calls and variant allele frequencies between different samples.  We identified subclonal driver mutations in several different genes in the primary tumor sample and found that one particular subclone dominated subsequent tumor samples at relapse.  This clone was marked by a novel TP53-KPNA3 translocation and loss of the opposite-strand wild-type TP53 allele.  Future research must focus on functional significance of such clones and strategies to eliminate them."

To assist the diagnosis of SPG subtypes, next-generation sequencing is often used to provide supporting evidence. In this study, we report the case of two probands from the same family with SPG symptoms, including bilateral lower limbs weakness, unsteady gait, cognitive decline, dysarthria and slurring of speech since age of 14. Subsequent whole-genome sequencing revealed that the patients are compound heterozygous for mutations in SPG11 gene, including the paternally inherited c.6856C&gt;T (p.Arg2286*) mutation and the novel maternally inherited c.2316+5G&gt;A splice donor region mutation. Mutations in SPG11 are the common cause of autosomal recessive Spastic Paraplegia type 11. According to the ClinVar database, there are already 101 reported pathogenic mutations in SPG11 that are associated with SPG. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SPG11 mutations in our local population. Novel splice mutation identified in this study would enrich the catalog of SPG11 mutations, potentially leading to better genetic diagnosis of SPG."

Characterizing their evolutionary landscape including the role of metastatic axillary lymph nodes to seed distant organ metastasis can provide rational basis for effective treatments. Here, we describe the genomic analyses of the primary tumors and metastatic lesions from 20 breast cancer patients (99 samples). Our evolutionary analyses revealed diverse spreading and seeding patterns governing tumor progression. Although linear evolution to successive metastatic sites was common, parallel evolution from the primary tumor to multiple distant sites was also evident. Metastatic spreading was frequently coupled with polyclonal seeding, where multiple metastatic subclones originated from primary tumor and/or other distant metastases.  Synchronous axillary lymph node metastasis, a well-established prognosticator of breast cancer, was not involved in seeding distant metastasis, suggesting haematogenous route for cancer dissemination. Clonal evolution coincided frequently with emerging driver alterations and evolving mutational processes, notably a significant increase in apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) associated mutagenesis. Our data provide the first genomic evidence regarding the role of axillary lymph node metastasis in seeding distant organ metastasis and elucidates the evolving mutational landscape during cancer progression."

To tackle this challenge we have developed a novel reChIP-seq approach that enriches for two distinct DNA-associated proteins in an unbiased and genome-wide manner. We illustrate the utility of our approach by identifying nucleosomes bivalently modified by H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in primary human CD4+ central memory T-cells (TCMs). We unravel widespread bivalency of many unmethylated CpG-rich regions in TCMs overlapping with transcriptional start sites of developmental regulators. Furthermore, reChIP-seq uncovers two yet unobserved classes of bivalency, where either H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 is mixed with low but detectable bivalency. We provide evidence that bivalency is established by an interplay between genome and epigenome and thus attains stability. Our described reChIP-seq approach augments conventional ChIP-seq and is broadly applicable in the study of co-localization of DNA-associated proteins to unravel the intricate possibilities of combinatorial action."

It also modifies the epigenome, with changes in DNA methylation, due to both random drift and variation within specific functional loci. Results: In a discovery set of 2,238 peripheral-blood genome-wide DNA methylomes (MeDIP-seq) aged 19-82 years, we identified 71 age-associated Differentially Methylated Regions (a-DMRs, p &lt; 1.85 x 10-8) within the Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) blocks of the NIH Catalogue of published GWAS SNPs. This included 52 novel regions, 29 within loci not covered by 450k or 27k Illumina array, and with marked enrichment for Poised Promoters and Enhancers across multiple cell types. In a replication set of 2,084 DNA methylomes, 95.7% of the a-DMRs showed the same direction of ageing effect, with 80.3% and 53.3% replicated to p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 1.85 x 10-8, respectively.

In this study, we sequence 173 genes in 2433 primary breast tumours that have copy number aberration (CNA), gene expression, and long-term clinical follow-up data.  We identify 40 mutation-driver (Mut-driver) genes, and determine associations between mutations, driver CNA profiles, clinical-pathological parameters, and survival.  We assess the clonal states of Mut-driver mutations, and estimate levels of intratumour heterogeneity using mutant allele fractions.   Associations between PIK3CA mutations and reduced survival are identified in three subgroups of ER-positive cancer (defined by amplification of 17q23, 11q13-14 or 8q24).  High levels of intratumour heterogeneity are in general associated with worse outcome, but highly aggressive tumours with 11q13-14 amplification have low levels of intratumour heterogeneity.  These results emphasise the importance of genome-based stratification of breast cancer, and have important implications for designing therapeutic strategies."

Secondly, we observed that pure tumor-specific changes are rare, as most (89-99%) DNA methylation alterations in MCL are within or in close proximity of those regions showing dynamic methylation in normal B cells. Several thousand of these differentially methylated regions in MCL show concurrent changes in enhancer-associated histone modifications, including a region located 650 Kb away from the MCL oncogene SOX11.

All humans carry at least a few HLOF variants, but the exact number of inactivated genes that can be tolerated is currently unknown-as are the phenotypic effects of losing function for most human genes. Here, we make use of 1432 whole exome sequences from five European populations to expand the catalogue of known human HLOF mutations; after stringent filtering of variants in our dataset, we identify a total of 173 HLOF mutations, 76 (44%) of which have not been observed previously. We find that population isolates are particularly well suited to surveys of novel HLOF genes because individuals in such populations carry extensive runs of homozygosity, which we show are enriched for novel, rare HLOF variants. Further, we make use of extensive phenotypic data to show that most HLOFs, ascertained in population-based samples, appear to have little detectable effect on the phenotype. On the contrary, we document several genes directly implicated in disease that seem to tolerate HLOF variants. Overall HLOF genes are enriched for olfactory receptor function and are expressed in testes more often than expected, consistent with reduced purifying selection and incipient pseudogenisation."

POLR2A mutant tumors reveal dysregulation of key meningeal identity genes, including WNT6 and ZIC1/ZIC42,3. In addition to POLR2A, NF2, SMARCB1, TRAF7, KLF4, AKT1, PIK3CA and SMO4-8, we also report somatic mutations in AKT3, PIK3R1, PRKAR1A, and SUFU in meningiomas.

Almost all cases with reduced natural killer (NK) cell function received a diagnosis, but the majority of the prospective cases remain genetically unexplained, highlighting genetic heterogeneity and environmental impact within HLH.

More recently, Argentina has had the highest proportion of influx of transoceanic migration between 1850 and 1940 of any Latin American country. Furthermore, the geographical distribution of immigrants was oriented towards the Pampa region of central-eastern Argentina and the Northeast, so different patterns of mixed ancestry throughout the country are expected. In this present work we aim to describe the history and structure of the Argentinean population. Thus far, we have collected DNA samples from 2904 participants from 15 dispersed regions in Argentina, from the Andean populations in the Northwest to the river lands of the Northeast. Our preliminary data includes genome-scale Illumina Exome Array 250K genotypes, plus next-generation sequencing data from uniformly spaced genomic regions targeted with a genotype-by- sequencing strategy (which covers 1.5% of the genome), for 375 participants from 9 of the 15 populations.

However, to understand how cancer progresses and ultimately modulates patient outcome, we also require an understanding of the molecular changes in the patient systemic response (SR). Toward this end, we generated and analyzed RNA profiles from tumor and matched blood samples in 173 BC patients. We designed a system (MIxT) to explore and link tightly co-expressed gene sets (modules) across matched tissues. The gene composition of modules, and their expression, largely vary across tissues. Distinct patterns of expression in the SR are predominantly detected in highly immunogenic BC subtypes. We also find that the expression pattern of a module in one tissue is correlated to the expression pattern of a module in the other tissue in a fashion that depends on subtype. For example, systemic immunosuppression is detected in basalL patients in a fashion that is proportional to the level of expression of several tumor modules highlighting immune evasion mechanisms active in these particular cancers."

This group of tumour cells is itself intrinsically highly heterogeneous, driven by the rapid mutation rate of cancer cells to become a mixture of different sub-populations. These different types of cells, called subclones, have different sets of mutations in their DNA. Because some subclones evolve from others, many subclones share mutations. While it is increasingly easy to determine what mutations are present in the tumor, it remains very difficult to determine which subclones have which mutations. The task of assigning mutations to subclones is called subclonal reconstruction.The ICGC-TCGA DREAM Somatic Mutation Calling - Tumour Heterogeneity Challenge (SMC-Het) is an international effort to improve standard methods for subclonal reconstruction: to quantify and genotype each individual cell population present within a tumor.

Different classes of memory T cells occur upon primary activation of naive T cells, however, their detailed differentiation pathway is not entirely clear. As part of the IHEC consortium, we generated genome-wide epigenetic maps of a number of CD4+ T cell memory (Tmem) stages including rare subsets such as terminally differentiated (TEMRA) and bone marrow-resident Tmem. We found that CD4+ T cells show progressive global DNA demethylation with differentiation into memory stages, which reflects their proliferative history and likely indicates their decline in differentiation and proliferation potential. Furthermore, transcriptomic profiling combined with co-regulation network analyses arranged different Tmem subsets into a successive differentiation pathway. In addition, we identified a number of epigenetically controlled candidate master regulators for Tmem formation, of which we functionally validated a new methylation-sensitive promoter for the known 'naive-keeper' transcription factor Foxp1. Our study highlights the power of epigenomic datasets in the elucidation of the cellular history but also of the functional potential of T cell populations including the identification of epigenetically controlled master regulators."

It is therefore crucial to assess their relative added value to optimise the sequence and combination of such technologies.  Patients and methods Within the MOSCATO-01 trial, we investigated the added value of whole exome sequencing (WES) in patients that did not present any molecular abnormality on array comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) and targeted gene panel sequencing (TGPS) using cancer specific panels. The pathogenicity potential and actionability of mutations detected on WES was assessed.  A publication is pending association with this study."

Here we describe an autosomal recessive human disease in two unrelated families characterized by a split foot defect, nail abnormalities of the hands and hearing loss, due to mutations disrupting the SAM domain of the protein kinase ZAK. ZAK is a member of the MAPKKK family with no known role in limb development. We show that Zak is expressed in the developing limbs and that a CRISPR/Cas-mediated knockout of the two Zak isoforms is embryonically lethal in mice. In contrast, a deletion of the SAM domain induces a complex hindlimb defect associated with downregulation of Trp63, a known split-hand/split-foot malformation disease gene. Our results identify ZAK as a key player in mammalian limb patterning and demonstrate the rapid utility of CRISPR/Cas genome editing to assign causality to human mutations in the mouse in less then 10 weeks."
EGAS00001001652,molecular analysis  circulating tumour cells identifies distinct profiles  chemosensitive  chemofractory patients  small cell lung cancer,"Most patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), a metastatic, aggressive disease are initially chemosensitive but relapse with acquired chemoresistance.  Some patients (~20%), defined as chemorefractory, relapse within 3 months of initial treatment. Molecular mechanisms differentiating chemosensitive from chemorefractory disease are unknown.  We examined circulating tumour cell (CTC) copy number aberrations (CNA) in pre-treatment blood samples to determine their potential as a minimally invasive biomarker to predict chemosensitive versus chemorefractory disease. Analysis of 80 CTC samples from 10 patients generated a CNA classifier correlating with subsequent response and relapse that was verified in 6 independent SCLC patient-derived CTC explants (1).  Longitudinal analysis of CTC CNA from 5 chemosensitive patients who subsequently relapsed and did not respond to chemotherapy rechallenge, failed to recapitulate baseline changes between chemosensitive and chemorefractory disease suggesting different underlying resistance mechanisms. These data highlight CTC utility to interrogate drug resistance and potentially, stratify patients according to predicted chemosensitivity in clinical trials of novel therapeutics."

Molecular approaches may provide insights into variation in the host response, enabling biomarker development. Recent evidence suggests that transcriptomic sepsis response signatures (SRSs) can define patient subgroups associated with early outcome in sepsis. In this context, using transcriptomic approaches, the co-applicants were the first to identify differential gene signatures, or immune endotypes, correlating with outcome in sepsis, (Davenport E. et al, The Lancet Respiratory medicine, 2016); potentially providing a path to personalised treatment in sepsis. Specifically, this work defined two groups based on transcriptomic profiles: SRS group 1 being more associated with endotoxin tolerance demonstrating an immunosuppressed signature and is associated with higher mortality, whereas, SRS2 is more immune-heightened. However, despite the importance of these findings, previous studies have been underpowered, and limited in depth of data, to resolve these endophenotypes further. In this context, the Bioresource for Adult Infectious Disease (BioAID) offers substantial opportunities in terms of power, depth and breadth of data linked to biological samples of patients presenting acutely with the sepsis syndrome across the UK.  BioAID currently holds samples for DNA, RNA, serum and microbial isolates for more than 4,000 individuals (with a planned recruit of 10,000 individuals) and therefore provides a powerful resource for examining the underlying biology and correlates of sepsis syndrome with a view to informing early risk stratification of patients, need for critical care, and treatments.

Using tumor-normal sample pairs from two different types of cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and medulloblastoma, we conducted a benchmarking exercise within the context of the International Cancer Genome Consortium. We compare sequencing methods, analysis pipelines, and even validation methods. Here we show that using PCR-free methods and increasing sequencing depth to ~100x showed benefits, as long as the tumor:control coverage ratio remains balanced. We observe widely varying mutation call rates and low concordance among analysis pipelines, reflecting the artifact-prone nature of the raw data and lack of standards for dealing with the artifacts.

To create an in vitro model that mimics this heterogeneity, we generated a panel of HPV-negative OSCC cell lines. By whole exome sequencing of the lines and matched patient blood samples, we demonstrate that the mutational spectrum of the lines is representative of primary OSCC in The Cancer Genome Atlas. We show that loss of function mutations in FAT1 (an atypical cadherin) and CASP8 (Caspase 8) frequently occur in the same tumour. OSCC cells with inactivating FAT1 mutations exhibited reduced intercellular adhesion. Knockdown of FAT1 and CASP8 individually or in combination in OSCC cells led to increased cell migration and clonal growth, resistance to Staurosporine-induced apoptosis and, in some cases, increased terminal differentiation. The OSCC lines represent a valuable resource for elucidating the impact of different mutations on tumour behaviour."

EGAS00001001662,pangea,"Prevalence of HIV continues to be high in parts of Southern Africa. In the face of vaccine failures, and limited impact of behavioral interventions, much hope is pinned on combination strategies involving antiretroviral therapy. However, there remains a major challenge in developing tools to detect reductions in incidence, or providing insights into continual transmissions, particularly in generalized HIV-1 epidemic settings. Could viral phylogenetics play a role in describing the epidemic and in assessing the impact of interventions?Phylogenetics is the study of evolutionary relationships among groups of organisms. Phylogenetic analysis has played a crucial role in increasing our understanding of many aspects of HIV biology, including identification of the zoonotic origin of the virus and its migration across the planet.  In developed countries, the opportunities presented by large-scale sequence datasets generated through universal treatment monitoring have promoted development of methodology for their analysis to better characterize the transmission of HIV within these epidemics. Different modelling approaches have been adopted in UK, European and US settings with the aim of establishing direct links between epidemiological models of infectious disease and the interpretation of viral sequence data, but even in these data-rich settings there is no consensus on the optimum approach overall.The greatest challenge to the characterization of HIV transmission is the complexity of the networks along which it spreads. These differ between populations, between risk groups and between communities and to date only concentrated epidemics have been studied. The current study is the first to develop a coherent approach to extending these analyses to generalized epidemics. This represents a potential major advance in monitoring the impact of new interventions to reduce HIV-1 spread, including the expanded use of antiretrovirals. Further, we are assessing the utility of embedding such approaches in future trials of new interventions.The PANGEA_HIV project aims to adapt modern molecular epidemiology and phylodynamics of HIV sequence data to generate new insights into HIV transmission dynamics in generalized epidemics in Africa, and to provide a potential new approach for the evaluation of transmission interventions.http://www.pangea-hiv.org/http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/collaboration/pangeaThese data are part of a pre-publication release.

A shift towards MES state and enhanced tumor aggressiveness of non-MES GBM stem-like cells by MES GBM-associated TAMs (MES-TAMs) were confirmed pre- clinically. Furthermore, comparison of transcriptome profiling of TAMs, isolated directly from patient tumors, identified MES-origin TAM signature.

EGAS00001001438, genome sequencing  paediatric high grade glioma cell lines,"INTRODUCTION: Chromosomal rearrangements resulting in novel fusion genes are strongly associated with cancer and numerous examples exist in both adult and childhood malignancies. Structural variants frequently result in chimeric proteins targetable by novel therapeutic approaches, an outcome desperately needed in paediatric high grade glioma (pHGG). These tumours are increasingly understood to be driven by specific mutations in the genes encoding the histone H3.3 variant (H3F3A) and the chaperones ATRX/DAXX, however to date there have been no reports of structural variation. We sought to address this by carrying out integrated analysis of whole genome and transcriptome sequencing of three pHGG cell lines. METHOD: We fully sequenced the genomes and transcriptomes of the pHGG cell lines KNS42 (H3F3A G34V, TP53 R342*), SF188 (TP53 G266E) and UW479 (TP53 R158L, DAXX S683Y) using the IlluminaHiSeq2000 platform at 37-40x (DNA) and generating 74-92 million reads (RNA), respectively. Structural variants were detected using an integration of computed copy number and BreakDancer and ChimeraScan pipelines, and validated in the reference cells by PCR/Sanger sequencing. Break-part and/or fusion FISH probes were generated for validated expressed fusion transcripts and screened on tissue microarrays containing 130 pHGG samples to look for recurrence in clinical specimens, and the functions of these fusions assessed. RESULTS: 305 DNA-level structural variants involving one gene at either end were nominated in the three pHGG cell lines, many involving genes that are co-amplified. Several genome breakpoints junctions found showed microhomology regions (1-4bp), which are characteristic of microhomology-mediated break-induced-replication (MMBIR). SF188 harboured a complex amplified sequence including the genes PDGFRA (4q12), MYC (8q24.1), CCND1 (11q13.3), MLL (11q23.3) and CDK4 (12q14.1) found to be present as an extra-chromosomal double minute. Overlay of genome with transcriptome data identified 26 expressed fusion transcripts associated with DNA-level breakpoints. These included TULP4:RPTOR (t6;17 - SF188), GORASP2:CDADC1 (t2;13 - KNS42) and AKAP6:NUBPL (t12;14 - UW479). CONCLUSIONS: Numerous expressed fusion transcripts have been identified in pHGG cells which confer dysregulation of a variety of known actionable targets in cancer-related signalling pathways. Although the prevalence of fusions in clinical pHGG is not suggestive of structural variation driving tumorigenesis in this disease, the generation of these fusions may be a complementary mechanism to pathway dysregulation (such as PI3K/mTOR). Integration with functional screening data may help to identify novel drug targets, such as the protein kinase CDADC1, knockdown of which selectively kills pHGG cells in vitro."

Whole genome sequencing revealed HPV integrants flanking and bridging extensive host genomic amplifications and rearrangements, including deletions, inversions and chromosomal translocations. We present a model of ³looping² by which HPV integrant-mediated DNA replication and recombination may result in viral-host DNA concatemers, frequently disrupting genes involved in oncogenesis and amplifying HPV oncogenes E6 and E7. Our high-resolution results shed new light on a catastrophic process, distinct from chromothripsis and other mutational processes, by which HPV directly promotes genomic instability."

EGAS00001003011,indonesian genome diversity project,"Indonesia, the world’s fourth largest country by population, comprises an archipelago of about 900 permanently inhabited islands in tropical Asia, and hosts an astonishing array of human diversity that remains largely underrepresented in modern biological surveys. The region is unique for its key role in both the early and recent evolution of Homo outside of Africa. It has one of the first traces of anatomically modern humans in Eurasia, and was the focus of extensive interaction between archaic hominins and humans – both in the likely co-existence of H. floresiensis with modern humans, and in the introgression of Denisovans into the ancestors of its present inhabitants. More recently, Indonesia was a center of the spread of Neolithic culture by Austronesian speakers. Advancing maritime technologies allowed farming populations to treat this region as a springboard to reach oceanic islands as remote as Madagascar, Hawaii, Easter Island and New Zealand. Here we present complete human genomes from healthy individuals from multiple key islands in Indonesia and Papua. The genomes were sequenced to high depth (30x). The purpose of this dataset is to address different questions of human evolution in Island Southeast Asia and beyond, including early settlement of the area by anatomically modern humans, population structure, genetic admixture and adaptation, and contacts with archaic hominins. We employed a sampling strategy to capture a broad range of diversity across the region incorporating an average of 12 samples from each of 14 islands spanning Indonesia and Papua, from Sumatra in the west to New Britain in the east. Genomes from this dataset form part of an ongoing project to describe and understand human evolutionary history in Island Southeast Asia and Eurasia in general."

These organoids expand long-term, are genetically stable and differentiate following treatment with reproductive hormones. Single cells from both endometrium and decidua can generate a fully functional organoid. The aim of this study is to use the established organoids as a discovery model by performing single cell RNA sequencing to identify the cell types present, with a particular focus on identifying the potential stem cell population.

However, limited annotation of the islet epigenome has constrained efforts to define the molecular mechanisms mediating the, largely regulatory, signals revealed by Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). We characterised patterns of chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq, n=17) and DNA methylation (whole-genome bisulphite sequencing, n=10) in human islets, generating high-resolution chromatin state maps through integration with established ChIP-seq marks. We found enrichment of GWAS signals for T2D and fasting glucose was concentrated in subsets of islet enhancers characterised by open chromatin and hypomethylation, with the former annotation predominant. At several loci (including CDC123, ADCY5, KLHDC5) the combination of fine-mapping genetic data and chromatin state enrichment maps, supplemented by allelic imbalance in chromatin accessibility pinpointed likely causal variants. The combination of increasingly-precise genetic and islet epigenomic information accelerates definition of causal mechanisms implicated in T2D pathogenesis."

The mutation pattern is defined by a dominative prevalence of C&gt;T mutations at TCN sites. Genes with a significant frequency of non-silent mutations include TP53 (47.1%), KRAS (7.8%), and ERBB3 (11.8%). Moreover, ErbB signaling (including EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3, ERBB4 and their downstream genes) is the most extensively mutated pathway, affecting 36.8% (21 of 57) of the GBC samples. Multivariate analyses further reveal that patients with ErbB pathway mutations have a worse outcome (P = 0.001).

In the present study, we describe clinical and genetic data from two patients, a mother and her daughter, with familial brain tumors. Exome sequencing revealed a germline missense mutation in the TP53 and ATRX genes in both cases, and a somatic copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in TP53 in both atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) and astrocytoma tumors. ATRX mutation was associated with the loss of ATRX protein expression. In the astrocytoma case, R132C missense mutation was found in the known hotspot site in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was detected in TP53. The mother carried few other somatic alterations, suggesting that the IDH1 mutation and LOH in TP53 were sufficient to drive tumor development. The genome in the AT/RT tumor was atypically aneuploid: most chromosomes had experienced copy-neutral LOH or whole chromosome gains. Only chromosome 18 had normal diploid status. INI1/hSNF5/SMARCB1 was homozygously deleted in the AT/RT tumor.

Covalent histone modifiers and subunits of the SWI/SNF complex are mutated in 40 and 22.2% of the cases, respectively, with MEN1, PSIP1 and ARID1A being recurrently affected. In contrast to small-cell lung cancer and large-cell neuroendocrine tumours, TP53 and RB1 mutations are rare events, suggesting that pulmonary carcinoids are not early progenitor lesions of the highly aggressive lung neuroendocrine tumors but arise through independent cellular mechanisms.

EGAS00001002343,copy number profiling  putative cancer stem  pleural effusion aspirates  breast cancer patients,"A common symptom during late stage breast cancer disease is pleural effusion, which is related to poor prognosis. In pleural effusions malignant cells can be detected, which indicates a metastatic spread from the primary tumor site. Beside the usefulness for investigation of the metastatic process, it has been a source to isolate cells with putative cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. For this study, pleural effusion aspirate from 25 metastatic breast cancer patients were processed to establish in vitro culture. Patient-derived aspirates were cultured under sphere forming conditions and isolated primary cultures were sorted for cancer stem cell populations ALDH1+ and CD44+CD24-/low and sphere forming efficiency of CSC and non-CSC subpopulation was determined. Unsorted cells had a higher potential to form spheres compared to CSC subpopulations. Subsequently, DNA was isolated from pleural effusions before and after cell sorting, to compare their copy number profiles generated by low-coverage whole genome sequencing to DNA from FFPE primary tumors or bone metastasis. Unbalanced profiles could be detected in four pleural samples before sorting, in two ALDH1+ sorted samples, in one CD44+CD24-/low and in all control samples.  Additionally, spheroid culture from one pleural sample could be passaged on and was characterized. Therefore, pleural effusions are an appropriate media for enrichment of putative CSC.

We interrogated the molecular interface between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and cancer cells in 143 samples from 21 patients with whole-genome sequencing, immunohistochemistry, histologic image analysis, gene expression, and T- and B-cell receptor sequencing. We show that mutational processes operating within cancer cells are linked to immune properties, with tumors bearing low abundance of foldback inversion rearrangements and high immune activity delineating most favorable treatment outcomes (n=433).Epithelial CD8+ TIL were associated with coupled evolutionary dynamics between immune and malignant populations, evidenced by suppressed clonal diversity, spatial tracking between T cells and tumor clones, and antigen-driven selection within B cells.

EGAS00001000476,negligible impact  missing heritability  autoimmune locus rare coding region variants,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common variants of modest effect size at hundreds of loci for common autoimmune diseases - however a substantial fraction of heritability remains unexplained, and to which rare variants may contribute.  To discover rare variants and test them for association with a phenotype, the majority of studies re-sequence a small initial sample size and then genotype the discovered variants in a larger sample set. This approach will fail to analyse a large fraction of the rare variants present in the entire sample set. Here we perform simultaneous amplicon sequencing-based variant discovery and genotyping for coding exons of 25 GWAS risk genes in 41,911 white-European origin UK subjects comprising 24,892 subjects with six autoimmune disease phenotypes and 17,019 controls, and show that rare coding-region variants at known loci play a negligible role in common autoimmune disease susceptibility. These results do not support the rare variant - synthetic genome-wide association hypothesis. Many known autoimmune disease risk loci contain multiple independent common and low frequency variant association signals, and so genes in these loci are a priori stronger candidates to harbor rare coding-region variants than other genes. Our data suggest that the missing heritability for common autoimmune diseases may not lie in the rare coding-region variant portion of the allelic spectrum, but perhaps as others have proposed in very many common variant signals of weak effect."

However a comprehensive comparative study of the characteristics of these hiPSCs has been missing from the literature. Importantly studies which aimed to address these aspects of hiPSCs have used cells from different patients. In order to avoid this important confounding variable and to keep the genetic background constant, tissue samples were procured from the patients and reprogrammed to iPS cells. The transcriptomes of these iPS cells will be compared.

EGAS00001000484, genome  transcriptome analysis   sporadic  recurring parathyroid carcinoma,"Parathyroid carcinoma is an extremely rare endocrine malignancy with an estimated incidence of less than 1 per million population. Excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone, extremely high serum calcium level and the deleterious effects of hypercalcemia are the clinical manifestations of the disease. Up to 60% of patients develop multiple disease recurrences and although long-term survival is possible with palliative surgery, permanent remission is rarely achieved. Molecular drivers of sporadic parathyroid carcinoma have remained largely unknown. Previous studies, mostly based on familial cases of the disease, suggested a potential role for the tumor suppressor MEN1 and proto-oncogene RET in benign parathyroid tumorigenesis while the tumor suppressor HRPT2 and proto-oncogene CCND1 may also act as drivers in parathyroid cancer. Here, we report the complete genomic analysis of a sporadic and recurring parathyroid carcinoma. Mutational landscapes of the primary and recurrent tumor specimens were analyzed using high throughput sequencing technologies. Such molecular profiling allowed for identification of somatic mutations never previously identified in this malignancy. These included single nucleotide point mutations in well characterized cancer genes such as mTOR, MLL2, CDKN2C and PIK3CA. Comparison of acquired mutations in patient-matched primary and recurrent tumors revealed loss of PIK3CA activating mutation during the evolution of the tumor from the primary to the recurrence. Structural variations leading to gene fusions and regions of copy loss and gain were identified at a single-base resolution. Loss of short arm of chromosome 1 along with somatic mis-sense and truncating mutations in CDKN2C and THRAP3, respectively, provide new evidence for the potential role of these genes as tumor suppressors in parathyroid cancer. The key somatic mutations indentified in this study can serve as novel diagnostic markers as well as therapeutic targets."

EGAS00001002348,mutational hotspot analysis  detection  ongoing mutagensis,"Signatures 2 and 13 reflect the second most prevalent mutational process operative in human cancer. Based on the similarity of the mutation types at the specific sequence context that constitute these signatures, they are speculated to stem from the aberrant activity of the APOBEC family of deaminases. We recently employed human cancer cell lines branded with signatures 2 and 13 to study activity of the mutational process generating them and found that only a subset continues to accumulate mutations over a period of time in culture. 

The over-arching aim of this project will be to expand the currently scarce repertoire of known human cancer cell lines with the on-going mutagenic activity attributed to two signatures described. Our previous experiments suggest that private mutations found across individual cells from a heterogeneous cell line population may identify samples with mutational processes that are still operative. Here, we will attempt to replace whole-exome sequencing to detect private mutations forming Signature 2 and 13 patterns, with a deep sequencing of Signature 2 and 13 hotspots recently identified in BASIS project. These will be amplified from cell lines that are hypermutators for signatures 2 and 13"
EGAS00001000547,distinct evolutionary trajectories  primary high grade serous ovarian cancers revealed  spatial mutational profiling,"High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) is characterized by poor outcome, often attributed to emergence of treatment-resistant sub-clones. We sought to measure the degree of genomic diversity within primary, untreated HGSC to examine the natural state of tumor evolution prior to therapy. We performed exome sequencing, copy number analysis, targeted amplicon deep sequencing and gene expression profiling on thirty-one spatially and temporally separated HGSC tumor specimens (six patients) including ovarian masses, distant metastases, and fallopian tube lesions. We found widespread intra-tumoral variation in mutation, copy number, and gene expression profiles, with key driver alterations in genes present in only a subset of samples (e.g. PIK3CA, CTNNB1, NF1). On average, only 51.5% of mutations were present in every sample of a given case (range: 10.2% to 91.4%), with TP53 as the only somatic mutation consistently present in all samples. Complex segmental aneuploidies, such as whole genome doubling, were present in a subset of samples from the same individual, with divergent copy number changes segregating independently of point mutation acquisition. Reconstruction of evolutionary histories showed one patient with mixed HGSC and endometrioid histology with common etiologic origin in the fallopian tube and subsequent selection of different driver mutations in the histologically distinct samples. In this patient, we observed mixed cell populations in the early fallopian tube lesion, indicating diversity arises at early stages of tumorigenesis. Our results reveal that HGSC exhibit highly individual evolutionary trajectories and diverse genomic tapestries prior to therapy, exposing an essential biological characteristic to inform future design of personalized therapeutic solutions and investigation of drug resistance mechanisms."

To understand the mechanisms underlying this biological heterogeneity, we performed whole-genome and/or whole-exome sequencing on 29 MCL cases and their respective matched normal DNA, as well as 6 MCL cell lines. Recurrently mutated genes were investigated by targeted sequencing in an independent cohort of 172 MCL patients. We identified 25 significantly mutated genes, including known drivers such as ataxia-telangectasia mutated (ATM), cyclin D1 (CCND1), and the tumor suppressor TP53; mutated genes encoding the anti-apoptotic protein BIRC3 and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2); and the chromatin modifiers WHSC1, MLL2, and MEF2B. We also found NOTCH2 mutations as an alternative phenomenon to NOTCH1 mutations in aggressive tumors with a dismal prognosis. Analysis of two simultaneous or subsequent MCL samples by whole-genome/whole-exome (n = 8) or targeted (n = 19) sequencing revealed subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis in samples from different topographic sites and modulation of the initial mutational profile at the progression of the disease. Some mutations were predominantly clonal or subclonal, indicating an early or late event in tumor evolution, respectively.

Transcriptome analysis of the individual populationsrevealed a large degree of conservation among vertebrates in the drivers of gene expression changes occurring at different steps of differentiation, althoughnotably, sometimes, different members of the same gene family are expressed. The transcriptome analysis establishes a resource to identify novel genes and pathways involved in human pancreas development. Single cell profiling further captured intermediate stages ofdifferentiation and enabled us to decipher the sequence of transcriptional events occurring during human endocrine differentiation. Furthermore, we evaluate how well individual pancreatic cells derived in vitro from human pluripotent stem cells mirror the natural processoccurring in human fetuses. This comparison uncovers a few differences at the progenitor steps, a convergence at the steps of endocrine induction and the current inability to fully resolve endocrine cell subtypes in vitro."

EGAS00001000145, study   genetic basis  evation  acute myeloid leukaemia  graft  leukaemia effects  allogeneic bone marrow transplantation,"Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is an aggressive and molecularly diverse disease with a poor overall survival of 20-25%. With an annual incidence of 2.9 per 100,000, AML is currently the commonest myeloid malignancy in Europe, yet the two main therapeutic options for this disease, anthracyclines and purine analogues, have remained unchanged for over 20 years. Currently patients are stratified at diagnosis according to a series of clinicopathological parameters (e.g. age, white cell count and presence/absence of previous clonal haematological disease) and molecular markers (e.g. chromosomal translocations/deletions, aneuploidy and mutations in genes such as FLT3 and NPM1). Patients with adverse prognostic features, whose prognosis is particularly poor (e.g. &lt;15% long-term survival) are offered treatment with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) if a sibling or unrelated donor is available. This can significantly improve survival (e.g. up to 40% long-term survival in some contexts), albeit at the expense of significant toxicity and transplant-related mortality (TRM). Allo-BMT is thought to work in part by allowing the delivery of large doses of chemotherapy followed by haemopoietic ""rescue"" with donor haemopoietic stem cells (haemopoietic failure would otherwise ensue).  However, potentially the most potent effect of allo-BMT is the cytotoxic effect of donor lymphocytes against AML blasts, a phenomenon known as graft-vs-leukaemia (GVL) effect. Increasingly, transplants using reduced chemotherapy intensity (mini-allografts) are being used that partially circumvent the toxicity from chemotherapy and rely on GVL to effect cure. Nevertheless, AML relapse after allo-BMT still occurs at a significant rate of up to 80% depending on the type of transplant. There is accumulating evidence that genetic events in residual leukaemic cells enable them to evade immunodetection and therefore survive the GVL effect and expand to cause relapse. The most striking example of this is the loss of HLA antigens after transplants in which donor and recipient are not fully HLA-matched. In these cases, the leukaemia ""deletes"" the genomic region containing the disparate HLA antigen which was preferentially targeted as ""foreign"" by the GVL effect. However, the genetic basis of immune evasion in the majority of transplants, which are fully HLA matched, is not known. One possibility is that loss of genes coding for antigens outside the HLA locus but which are also targets of GVL may operate, alternatively genetic events that affect processes downstream of immunological cytotoxicity may be responsible.The identification of genetic events that mediate immune evasion would not only facilitate the understanding of this process but can help plan therapeutic interventions that improve the outcomes of allogeneic transplantation for AML and other disorders. We intend to study this by conducting exome sequencing on 6 cases of AMLs from patients that attend my clinic at Addenbrooke's hospital and have relapsed after allogeneic transplantation. Samples from AML diagnosis, remission/normal and AML relapse (total n=18) will be studied to identify somatic mutations in the primary AML and those acquired by the relapsed clone. The 18 samples will also be studied by array CGH to detect regions of genomic amplification or deletion."

We uncover a larger than expected proportion of germline mutations in clinically sporadic PanNETs. These include previously unreported mutations in DNA repair genes MUTYH, CHEK2, BRCA2, and PALB2, which together with MEN1 and VHL occur in 16% of patients. Somatic mutations (point mutations and structural rearrangements) commonly occurred in genes involved in 4 main pathways: chromatin remodelling, DNA damage repair, activation of mTOR signalling (including novel EWSR1 gene fusions) and telomere maintenance. Aberrations in these mechanisms are associated with subtypes of PanNET with potential clinical application for prognostic and therapeutic stratification."

Despite the overall poor prognosis, ACC outcome is heterogeneous. CTNNB1 and TP53 mutations are frequent in these tumors, but the complete spectrum of genetic changes remains undefined.  Exome sequencing and SNP array analysis of 45 ACC revealed recurrent alterations in known drivers (CTNNB1, TP53, CDKN2A, RB1,  MEN1)  and genes not previously reported to be altered in ACC (ZNRF3, DAXX, TERT and MED12), which were validated in an independent cohort of 77 ACC.  The cell-surface transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase ZNRF36 was the gene the most frequently altered (21%), and appears as a potential novel tumor suppressor gene related to the ß-catenin pathway. Our integrated genomic analyses led to the identification of two distinct molecular subgroups with opposite outcome. The C1A group of poor outcome ACC was characterized by numerous mutations and DNA methylation alterations, whereas the C1B group with good prognosis displayed a specific deregulation of two miRNA clusters.  Thus, aggressive and indolent ACC correspond to two distinct molecular entities, driven by different oncogenic alterations.Array based dataset for this study has been made public at:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE49280."

RNA sequencing was completed using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 system. Presence of the EWSR1-WT1 fusion was verified using both RNA-sequencing and PCR. Validation studies, including WT1 ChIP-seq, RNA sequencing, and EWS-WT1 knockdown experiments, were performed on an established DSRCT cell line, JN-DSRCT-1. Protein expression of clinically relevant genes determined by RNA sequencing was confirmed using immunohistochemistry. A panel of immune signature genes was also evaluated to identify possible immune therapeutic targets.  Results: We analyzed the RNA from 14 tumor samples, of which two were confirmed negative for the diagnostic EWSR1-WT1 translocation. Principal component analysis of the sequencing data indicated that fusion-negative and fusion-positive tumors are transcriptionally distinct entities.  Overlapping the significant ChIP-seq peaks with genes found to be highly expressed in the RNA sequencing data revealed that IGF2 and FGFR4 were both highly expressed, and targets of the EWS-WT1 fusion gene. This finding has potential clinical relevance for targeted therapeutic intervention. In addition, we identified the immune checkpoints CD200 and CD276 as potentially targetable genes whose expression is independent of the EWS-WT1 fusion gene in vitro.Conclusions: Despite the transcriptional complexity of this disease, we were able to identify IGF2, FGFR4, CD200, and CD276 as potential therapeutic targets for patients suffering from DSRCT."

The most established risk factors of HCC are chronic HBV and HCV infection. HBV infection is responsible for over 50% of the worldwide attributable risk of HCC, especially in East Asia and Africa, while in Japan and several Western countries HCV infection is the most common risk factor for HCC. To gain insights into the molecular alterations of virus-associated HCC, we performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 321 HCC tumors from 159 patients.

Here we present an integrated genomic and transcriptomic analysis of 335 primary lung adenocarcinomas and 35 corresponding lymph node metastases from Chinese patients. Altogether 13 significantly mutated genes are identified, including themost commonly mutated gene TP53 and novel mutation targets such as RHPN2, GLI3 and MRC2. TP53 mutations are furthermore significantly enriched in tumours from patients harbouring metastases. Genes regulating cytoskeleton remodelling processes are also frequently altered, especially in metastatic samples, of which the high expression level of IQGAP3 is identified as a marker for poor prognosis. Our study represents the first large-scalesequencing effort on lung adenocarcinoma in Asian patients and provides a comprehensive mutational landscape for both primary and metastatic tumours. This may thus form a basis for personalized medical care and shed light on the molecular pathogenesis of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma."

EGAS00001001226,analysis  lowfrequency coding variants  cardiometabolic traits epic,"The new round of meta-analysis in CAD/MI undertaken currently by CARDIoGRAMplusC4D which I am leading, has brought the total number of confirmed genome wide significant loci to 44 but as seen for other common diseases they collectively explain a modest  fraction of the genetic component. We have start seeing evidence of multiple independent variants among several of the 26 CAD loci that are undergoing fine mappping. Similarly in the lipid consortium a further 88 new loci have been identified in the current round bringing the total to over 180. Low frequency variants on the Metabochip were selected from an early release of the 1000 genomes project and therefore assessing the contribution of such variants to disease risk is incomplete.Based on a SNP set derived from 12,000 exomes and whole genomes an iSELECT array of circa 250,000 markers is been generated. The array will include mainly exonic SNPs (~246K) of which ~145 are non-synonymous. Inclusion criteria consisted of a SNP to be seen in at least 3 individuals and across at least two data sets.  Although most of the contributed data sets correspond to healthy individuals there was inclusion of variants derived from a few disease oriented exome studies one of which is the NHLBI funded effort on myocardial infarction. In addition, the exome array will include the most up to date GWA / metabochip hits from several consortia including GLGC( lipid) and CARDIoGRAMplusC4D (coronary artery disease (CAD)). The array includes some generic marker sets e.g. HLA, mitDNA, Y chromosome etc.The exome array provides an excellent opportunity to interrogate in a comprehensive way coding variants at the genome level including low frequency ones at a rather low cost. Availability of large sample collections will be essential to assess the impact of low frequency variants to disease risk. I am proposing a study to test the exome marker set for lipids and CAD/MI in 16000 people (5500 cases and 10,000 (possibly more) controls).I will seek validation of initial findings through CARDIoGRAMplusC4D which comprises over 60,000 CAD/MI cases and 120,000 controlsThe study will combine data generated as part of the WTCCC /UK exome consortium with data on 5000 samples (to include 4000 CAD/MI cases) for which I am requesting core funding under Aim 1.1 of Project 3: Genetics of Common Diseases. The 5000 samples include (i) 2000 CAD/MI cases from the EPIC-Norfolk cohort (ii) 1000 CAD/MI cases from the BHF collection and (iii) our Greek cohort THISEAS (1000 cases and 1000 controls) which has data on multiple cardiometabolic traits.  UK controls will come from the UK exome consortium effort to build a large UK control set. This effort which includes WTCCC investigators and a few other UK groups (cancer, lung function, Alzheimer's) aims to type up to 15,000 controls - WTCCC is funding 9,500 of the controls.  The selection of UK control sets is currently under discussion but one of the criteria is availability of other phenotypes and the 1958 British Birth Cohort (6500 samples) had unanimous support. Other relevant cohorts are: UKBloodService (3K), GRAPHIC (2K), Cambridge bioresource (8K), Oxford Biobank (3K), and Twins UK (6K). Finally, WTCCC is funding 1500 cases per participating disease phenotype; the 1500 CAD allocation (represented by Nilesh Samani and myself) will bring the total number of cases to 5500.Such a data set will not only drive the initial analysis round but will allow participation in subsequent meta-analyses as well as contributions in parallel international efforts e.g haematological and anthropometric traits, blood pressure, etc"

This includes 619 patients with severe sepsis due to community acquired pneumonia and 359 with severe sepsis due to faecal peritonitis. Comprehensive clinical phenotyping and microbiology was recorded including at up to 6 months following hospital discharge. The 28-day mortality was 21%. Blood samples were taken on admission, on day 3 and on day 5 following ICU admission where possible. Peripheral blood leukocytes were isolated and stored for RNA extraction with high quality RNA obtained (average RIN 8.0); genomic DNA was extracted; buffy coats, plasma and urine samples were stored for each patient. Transcriptomic profiling by microarray has been performed for 478 patients (Illumina Human HT12v4 Expression Beadchips) and genotyping for 295 patients (Illumina HumanOmniExpress BeadChips). Using this data, analysis has revealed transcriptomic signatures of severe sepsis informative for understanding disease heterogeneity and outcome; and expression quantitative trait mapping demonstrates sepsis specific eQTL.

EGAS00001000643,spatial  temporal evolution  distal 10q deletion  prognostically unfavorable event  diffuse low grade gliomas,"Background: The disease course of patients with diffuse low-grade glioma is notoriously unpredictable. Temporal and spatially distinct samples may provide insight into the evolution of clinically relevant copy number aberrations (CNAs). The purpose of this study is to identify CNAs that are indicative of aggressive tumor behaviour and can thereby complement the prognostically favorable 1p/19q co-deletion. Results: Genome-wide, 50 base pair single-end, sequencing was performed to detect CNAs in a clinically well-characterized cohort of 98 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded low-grade gliomas. CNAs are correlated with overall survival as an endpoint. Seventy-five additional samples from spatially distinct regions and paired recurrent tumors of the discovery cohort were analysed to interrogate the intratumoral heterogeneity and spatial evolution. Loss of 10q25.2-qter is a frequent subclonal event and significantly correlates with an unfavorable prognosis. A significant correlation is furthermore observed in a validation set of 126 and confirmation set of 184 patients. Loss of 10q25.2-qter arises in a longitudinal manner in paired recurrent tumor specimens, whereas the prognostically favorable 1p/ 19q co-deletion is the only CNA that is stable across spatial regions and recurrent tumors. Conclusions: CNAs in low-grade gliomas display extensive intratumoral heterogeneity. Distal loss of 10q is a late onset event and a marker for reduced overall survival in low-grade glioma patients. Intratumoral heterogeneity and higher frequencies of distal 10q loss in recurrences suggest this event is involved in outgrowth to the recurrent tumor."

Sequencing of small numbers of Ph-like ALL cases has identified genetic alterations activating kinase signaling suggesting Ph-like ALL may be amenable to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, the spectrum of genetic alterations in childhood and adult Ph-like ALL is incompletely understood. Methods: We performed genomic profiling of 1736 B-ALL cases and next-generation sequencing for 160 Ph-like cases. We examined the functional effects of chimeric fusion proteins in mouse cell lines.  Results: The frequency of Ph-like ALL rose from 11% in children to 26% in young adults, and was associated with very poor outcome. Kinase-activating alterations were identified in 90% of Ph-like cases, most commonly fusions involving 10 kinase or cytokine receptor genes (ABL1, ABL2, CRLF2, CSF1R, EPOR, JAK2, NTRK3, PDGFRB, PTK2B and TYK2), and mutations involving FLT3, IL7R and SH2B3. Expression of ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R and JAK2 fusions resulted in cytokine-independent proliferation of cell lines and activation of pSTAT5. Cells expressing ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R and PDGFRB fusions were sensitive to dasatinib, and JAK2 fusions to ruxolitinib.  Conclusions: Ph-like ALL is characterized by a diverse range of genomic alterations that converge on a limited number of kinase signaling pathways amenable to inhibition with currently available tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Trials identifying Ph-like ALL and testing the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy are warranted"

In an index patient with more than 100,000 circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in serial blood analyses, whole genome, exome, or targeted deep sequencing of the primary tumor, metastases, and 551 CTCs were consistent with a genetically homogeneous cancer. However, the allele fractions (AFs) of ctDNA were only 2-3% in each analysis, which did neither reflect the tumor burden nor the dynamics of this progressive disease by far. Indeed, plasma analyses of 71 further patients demonstrated highly variable AFs of mutant fragments, which frequently did not correspond to the tumor burden.

However, despite genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identifying several COPD-related genes, we know a significant proportion of the trait’s heritability remains unexplained. We therefore performed the first genome-wide SNP-SNP interaction (epistasis) analysis in COPD, as we suspect epistasis holds the key to at least part of the missing heritability. We used the NELSON cohort as a discovery set, comprising 1,030 cases and 1,808 controls, and the LifeLines cohort as a replication set, with 711 cases and 3,013 controls. Our results show SNP-SNP interactions suggesting that cell adhesion and cell communication pathways could be involved in COPD development. SNPs involved in these interactions are annotated to genes that include SERPINB9, CNTN5, PTPRM and SIGLEC1, and which, except for CNTN5, were not previously associated with COPD. Our findings may open up new avenues towards understanding pathways underlying COPD. However, since genome-wide significance was not reached, we should interpret these findings with caution and further replication is needed to confirm our findings."

We found that PCC/PGL are characterized by a low mutation rate, with few recurrent somatic mutations and focal copy number alterations (CNAs). In contrast, we detected recurrent broad CNAs strongly associated with known molecular groups, often leading to the biallelic inactivation of the known susceptibility genes of PCC/PGL. We also identified DNA methylation changes and miRNA expression clusters strongly associated with molecular groups. Of note, overexpression of the miRNA cluster 182/96/183 is specific of SDHB-mutated tumors and induces invasive traits, whereas silencing of the imprinted DLK1-MEG3 miRNA cluster due to a loss of heterozygosity of the 14q32.2 locus is a potential driver in a subset of sporadic tumors.

In serial plasma analyses, we observe changes in focal amplifications in 40% of cases. The mean time interval between new amplifications was 26.4 weeks (range: 5-52 weeks), suggesting that they represent rapid adaptations to selection pressure. An increase in neuron-specific enolase is accompanied by clonal pattern changes in the tumor genome, most consistent with subclonal diversification of the tumor.

EGAS00001000901, genomic landscape  childhood  adolescent melanoma,"Despite remarkable advances in the genomic characterization of adult melanoma, the molecular pathogenesis of pediatric melanoma remains largely unknown. We analyzed 15 conventional melanomas (CM), 3 melanomas arising in congenital nevi (CNM), and 5 spitzoid melanomas (SM), using various platforms, including whole genome or exome sequencing, molecular inversion probe assay, and/or targeted sequencing. CM demonstrated a high burden of somatic single nucleotide variations (SNV), with each case containing a TERT promoter (TERT-p) mutation, 13/15 containing an activating BRAF V600 mutation, and &gt;80% of the identified SNV consistent with UV damage. By contrast, the 3 CNM contained an activating NRAS Q61 mutation and no TERT-p mutations. SM were characterized by chromosomal rearrangements resulting in activated kinase signaling in 40%, and an absence of TERT-p mutations except for the one SM that succumbed to hematogenous metastasis. We conclude that pediatric CM has a very similar UV-induced mutational spectrum to that found in the adult counterpart, emphasizing the need to promote sun protection practices in early life and to improve access to therapeutic agents being explored in adults in young patients. By contrast, the pathogenesis of CNM appears to be distinct. TERT-p mutations may identify the rare subset of spitzoid melanocytic lesions prone to disseminate."

To better understand the genetic basis for MPNSTs, we performed whole genome sequencing on four MPNSTs from patients with neurofibromatosis 1 and found that each of them had a somatic, inactivating mutation of SUZ12, a chromatin modifying gene adjacent to the NF1 gene responsible for the benign neurofibromas in these patients. We then performed targeted sequencing on an additional 46 MPNSTs and found that 12 had somatic mutations in SUZ12. Fifteen of the 17 (88%) mutations in SUZ12 were predicted to inactivate protein function, implicating it as a tumor suppressor gene possibly responsible for the progression from neurofibromas to MPNTs."

ITH of lung cancers has not been well studied.   Methods: We performed multi-region whole exome sequencing (average sequencing depth 277x) on 48 tumor regions from 11 resected lung adenocarcinomas (8 stage I, 2 stage II and one stage III tumors) followed by deep sequencing validation (average sequencing depth 863x).   Results: All tumors showed clear evidence of spatial ITH. On average, 76% of all mutations and 20/21 known cancer gene mutations were present in all regions of individual tumors (trunk mutations). Copy number analysis did not show substantial difference in large-scale chromosome aberrations. A canonical KRAS p.G12C mutation was detected in only 1 of 4 tumor regions (branch mutations) at exome depth but detected in all four tumor regions (trunk mutations) at increased sequencing depth. In addition, many heterogeneous branch mutations defined by exome sequencing were detectable in all regions of individual tumors with increasing sequencing depth. Significant differences in mutational spectrum were observed in 6 tumors indicating that specific mutational processes were likely operative at different times during development of these tumors. With a median follow up of 21 months post surgery, 3 patients have relapsed and all 3 patients presented with significantly larger fractions of subclonal mutations in their primary tumors.   Conclusions: Although multi-region sampling is still required to fully assess ITH complexity, single biopsy analysis at appropriate depth might be sufficient to identify the majority of known cancer gene mutations in localized lung adenocarcinomas. Larger subclonal mutation fractions may be associated with increased likelihood of postsurgical relapse in patients with localized lung adenocarcinomas. Studies on larger cohort, ideally with comprehensive clinical annotation and repeat biopsy at relapse are needed to fully understand the clinical impact of ITH."

More than 200 known different variants can lead to the disease and are mainly found in populations that have been exposed to malaria parasites. We recently described a duplication of 4 nucleotides in the first exon of beta-globin gene in several families of patients living in Nord-Pas-de-Calais (France). Using the genotypes at 12 microsatellite markers surrounding the beta-globin gene of four unrelated variant carriers plus an additional one recently discovered, we found that they shared a common haplotype indicating a founder effect that was estimated to have taken place 225 years ago (9 generations). In order to determine whether this variant arose in this region of Northern-Europe or was introduced by migrants from regions of the world where thalassemia is endemic, we genotyped the first 4 unrelated variant carriers and 32 controls from Nord-Pas-de-Calais for 97 European ancestry informative markers (EAIMs). Using these EAIMs and comparing with population reference panels, we demonstrated that the variant carriers were very similar to the controls and were closer to North European populations than to South European or Middle-East populations.  Rare beta-thalassemia variants have already been described in patients sampled in non-endemic regions but it is the first proof of a founder effect in Northern Europe.

In order to quantify mutations, semen from two individuals are sequenced. 48 single sperm cells are isolated from each individual, and their DNA is extracted. The resulting genomes are amplified using PicoPlex, GenomiPhi MDA, Repli-G MDA, and MALBAC. QC step is applied to check the quality of WGA DNA using standard Sequenom plex (26 SNPs). A subset of 32 amplification products which pass the intiall QC, are genotyped using Affymetrix SNP6 chips. 12 of the genotyped amplification products are also sequenced. In addition, one multi-cell sample per individual is sequenced as a reference and for validation purposes.Altogether, 12 single cell sperm genomes and two multi-cell genomes are sequenced, coming to a total of 14 genomes.

EGAS00001000968,origins  functional consequence  somatic mitochondrial dna mutations,"Recent sequencing studies have extensively explored the somatic alterations present in the nuclear genomes of cancers. Although mitochondria control energy metabolism and apoptosis, the origins and impact of cancer-associated mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are unclear. Here, we analysed somatic alterations in mtDNA from 1,675 tumors across 31 histologies. We identified 1,907 somatic substitutions, which exhibited dramatic replicative strand bias, predominantly C&gt;T and A&gt;G on the mitochondrial heavy strand. This strand-asymmetric signature differs from those found in nuclear cancer genomes but matches the inferred germline process shaping primate mtDNA sequence content. Numbers of mtDNA mutations showed considerable heterogeneity across tumor types. Missense mutations were selectively neutral and often gradually drifted towards homoplasmy over time. In contrast, mutations resulting in protein truncation undergo negative selection and were almost exclusively heteroplasmic. Our findings indicate that the endogenous mutational mechanism has far greater impact than any other external mutagens in mitochondria, and is fundamentally linked to mtDNA replication."

We performed multi-region sequencing on 25 regions from seven early-stage NSCLCs. Spatial dissection revealed branched tumor evolution, with driver mutations occurring before and after subclonal diversification. Intra-tumor heterogeneity in DNA copy number alterations, translocations and endogenous APOBEC mutational processes, demonstrates that NSCLC may follow multiple distinct evolutionary trajectories simultaneously. In smokers, despite maintained carcinogen exposure, temporal dissection reveals a proportional decrease in smoking-related mutations during tumor progression, accompanied by an increase in APOBEC-related mutations. We observed genome-doubling events early in tumor development of ex-smokers, suggesting prolonged latency periods before clinical detection. Multi-region sequencing demonstrates the relentless and heterogeneous nature of genomic instability processes in early-stage NSCLCs."

EGAS00001000750,genomic catastrophes frequently   esophageal adenocarcinoma  drive tumorigenesis,"Oesophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) incidence is rapidly increasing in Western countries. A better understanding of EAC underpins efforts to improve early detection and treatment outcomes. While large EAC exome sequencing efforts to date have found recurrent loss-of-function mutations, oncogenic driving events have been underrepresented. Here we use a combination of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and single-nucleotide polymorphism-array profiling to show that genomic catastrophes are frequent in EAC, with almost a third (32%, n=40/123) undergoing chromothriptic events. WGS of 22 EAC cases show that catastrophes may lead to oncogene amplification through chromothripsis-derived double-minute chromosome formation (MYC and MDM2) or breakage-fusion-bridge (KRAS, MDM2 and RFC3). Telomere shortening is more prominent in EACs bearing localized complex rearrangements. Mutational signature analysis also confirms that extreme genomic instability in EAC can be driven by somatic BRCA2 mutations. These findings suggest that genomic catastrophes have a significant role in the malignant transformation of EAC."

Although this therapy is expected to be effective beyond germline BRCA1/2 mutated carriers, a robust validated test to detect HRD tumors is lacking. In the present study we therefore evaluated a functional HR assay exploiting the formation of RAD51 foci in proliferating cells after ex vivo irradiation of fresh breast cancers (BrC) tissue: the RECAP test.Methods Fresh samples of 170 primary BrC were analyzed using the RECAP test. The molecular explanation for the HRD phenotype was investigated by exploring BRCA deficiencies, mutational signatures, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and microsatellite instability (MSI).Results RECAP was completed successfully in 148 out of 170 samples (87%). 24 tumors showed HRD (16%), while 6 tumors were HR intermediate (HRi) (4%). HRD was explained by BRCA deficiencies (mutations, promoter hypermethylation, deletions) in 16 cases. Several non-BRCA deficient HRD tumors showed BRCAness mutational signatures, suggesting that they are also bona fide HRD cases. HRD tumors showed an increased incidence of high TIL counts (p=0.023) compared to HR proficient (HRP) tumors and MSI was more frequently observed in the HRD group (2/20, 10%) than expected in BrC (1%) (p=0.017).Conclusion The RECAP test is a robust assay detecting both BRCA1/2 deficient and BRCA1/2 proficient HRD tumors, suggesting that this test identifies approximately 50% more patients that may benefit from PARPi treatment than BRCA gene testing only."

Most cSCC progress from a UV-induced precancerous lesion termed actinic keratosis (AK). Despite various efforts to characterize these lesions molecularly, the etiology of AK and its progression to cSCC remain only partially understood. Here we have used Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChips to interrogate the DNA methylation status of about 850.000 CpGs in epidermal preparations from healthy skin, AK and cSCC. Importantly, we found that the premalignant AK samples displayed classical features of cancer methylomes and were highly similar to cSCC methylomes. Further analysis identified typical features of stem cell methylomes, such as a reduced DNA methylation age, non-CpG methylation and stem cell-related keratin and enhancer methylation patterns. Interestingly, this signature was detected only in one half of the AK and cSCC samples, while the other half showed keratin and enhancer methylation patterns that were more closely related to the control epidermis. These findings suggest the existence of two distinct subclasses of AK and cSCC that originate from distinct keratinocyte differentiation stages."

Here, we profiled 148 genomes with 91 matching transcriptomes in an R-CHOP-treated DLBCL cohort to uncover molecular subgroups linked to treatment failure. Systematic integration of high-resolution genotyping arrays and RNA-seq data revealed novel deletions in RCOR1 to be associated with unfavorable progression free survival (P = 0.001). Integration of expression data from the clinical samples with data from RCOR1 knockdowns in the lymphoma cell lines KM-H2 and Raji yielded an RCOR1 loss-associated gene signature comprising of 233 genes. This signature identified a subgroup of patients with unfavorable overall survival (OS) (P = 0.023). The prognostic significance of the 233-gene signature for OS was reproduced in an independent cohort comprising of 195 R- CHOP treated patients (P = 0.039). Additionally, we discovered that within the IPI low risk group, the gene signature provides additional prognostic value that was independent of the cell-of-origin phenotype. Taken together, we present a novel and reproducible molecular subgroup of DLBCL, impacting risk-stratification of R- CHOP treated DLBCL patients and revealing a new avenue for therapeutic intervention strategies."

Six SQTS susceptibility genes, encoding cation channels, explain less than 25% of SQTS cases. Here we identify a missense mutation in the anion exchanger (AE3)-encoding SLC4A3 gene in two unrelated families with SQTS. The mutation causes reduced surface expression of AE3 and reduced membrane bicarbonate transport. Slc4a3 knockdown in zebrafish causes increased cardiac pHi, short QTc, and reduced systolic duration, which is rescued by wildtype but not mutated SLC4A3. Mechanistic analyses suggest that an increase in pHi and decrease in [Cl-]i  shortened the action potential duration. However, other mechanisms may also play a role.

EGAS00001001009,biased allelic expression  human primary fibroblast single cells,"The study of gene expression in mammalian single cells using genomic technologies now provides the possibility to investigate the patterns of allelic gene expression. We have used single-cell RNA sequencing to detect the allele-specific mRNA level in 203 single human primary fibroblast cells over 133,633 unique heterozygous single nucleotide variants (hetSNVs). We have observed that at the snapshot of analyses each cell contains mostly transcripts from one allele from the majority of genes; indeed 76.4% of the hetSNVs display stochastic monoallelic expression in single cells. Remarkably, adjacent hetSNVs exhibit haplotype consistent allelic ratio; in contrast distant sites located in two different genes are independent of the haplotype structure. Moreover, the allele-specific expression in single cells correlated with the abundance of the cellular transcript. We observed that genes expressing both alleles in majority of the single cells at a given time point are rare and enriched in highly expressed genes. The relative abundance of each allele in a cell is controlled by some regulatory mechanisms since we observed related single-cell allelic profiles according to genes.

EGAS00001000598,rb1 gene inactivation  chromothripsis  human retinoblastoma,"Retinoblastoma is a rare childhood cancer of the developing retina. Most retinoblastomas initiate with biallelic inactivation of the RB1 gene through diverse mechanisms including point mutations, nucleotide insertions, deletions, loss of heterozygosity and promoter hypermethylation. Recently, a novel mechanism of retinoblastoma initiation was proposed. Gallie and colleagues discovered that a small proportion of retinoblastomas lack RB1 mutations and had MYCN amplification [1]. In this study, we identified recurrent chromosomal, regional and focal genomic lesions in 94 primary retinoblastomas with their matched normal DNA using SNP 6.0 chips. We also analyzed the RB1 gene mutations and compared the mechanism of RB1 inactivation to the recurrent copy number variations in the retinoblastoma genome.  In addition to the previously described focal amplification of MYCN and deletions in RB1 and BCOR, we also identified recurrent focal amplification of OTX2, a transcription factor required for retinal photoreceptor development. We identified 10 retinoblastomas in our cohort that lacked RB1 point mutations or indels. We performed whole genome sequencing on those 10 tumors and their corresponding germline DNA. In one of the tumors, the RB1 gene was unaltered, the MYCN gene was amplified and RB1 protein was expressed in the nuclei of the tumor cells. In addition, several tumors had complex patterns of structural variations and we identified 3 tumors with chromothripsis at the RB1 locus. This is the first report of chromothripsis as a mechanism for RB1 gene inactivation in cancer."

EGAS00001000621, genome sequencing  asian lung cancers second hand smoke   responsible  higher incidence  lung cancer  asian  smokers,"Background Asian nonsmoking populations have a higher incidence of lung cancer compared to their European counterparts. There is a long-standing hypothesis that the increase of lung cancer in Asian never-smokers is due to environmental factors such as second-hand smoke. Results We analyzed whole-genome sequencing of 30 Asian lung cancers. Unsupervised clustering of mutational signatures separated the patients into two categories: i) all of the never-smokers, and ii) only smokers or ex-smokers. Half of the ex-smokers / smokers were in the never-smoker-like cluster. The overall somatic variant profiles of Asian lung cancers were similar to that of European origin with G.C&gt;T.A being predominant in smokers. We found EGFR and TP53 are the most frequently mutated genes with mutations in 50% and 27% of individuals, respectively. Among these Asian never-smokers, 71% had an EGFR mutation compared to 20% of the smokers in the smoking cluster. Other frequently mutated genes include RYR2, SATB2, C1orf88, FERMT1 and CTNNB1. Somatic alterations occurred in WNT signaling pathway genes, suggesting this pathway plays a role in both Western and Asian lung cancers. Conclusions Asian never-smokers have lung cancer signatures distinct from the smoker signature and their mutation profiles are similar to that of European never-smokers. The profiles of Asian and European smokers are also similar. This suggests that the same mutational mechanisms underlie the etiology for both ethnic groups, and the high incidence of lung cancer in Asian never-smokers might not be due to second hand smoke or other carcinogens that cause oxidative DNA damage. Half of the ex-smokers/smokers have a molecular phenotype similar to never-smokers; of which, 50% had EGFR mutations.  This suggests that routine EGFR testing is warranted in the Asian population, regardless of smoking status."

Large scale hypomethylation of repetitive regions, as well as a deficient calcium transport, have been reported in many stress related diseases, as well as in many cancers and biological aging. Thus our findings may aid in our understanding of how susceptibility to these diseases develops."

EGAS00001001085,capture   identifies  chromatin interactome  colorectal cancer risk loci,"Multiple regulatory elements distant to their targets on the linear genome can influence the expression of a single gene through chromatin looping. Chromosome conformation capture implemented in Hi-C allows for genome-wide agnostic characterization of chromatin contacts. However, detection of functional enhancer-promoter interactions is precluded by its effective resolution that is determined by both restriction fragmentation and sensitivity of the experiment. Here we have developed a capture Hi-C (cHi-C) approach to allow an agnostic characterisation of these physical interactions on a genome-wide scale. Single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with complex diseases often reside within regulatory elements and exert effects through long-range regulation of gene expression. Applying this cHi-C approach to 14 colorectal cancer risk loci has allowed us to identify key long-range chromatin interactions in cis and trans involving these loci."
EGAS00001000829,detection  clinically relevant genetic variants  autism spectrum disorder   genome sequencing,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) demonstrates high heritability and familial clustering, yet the genetic causes remain only partially understood as a result of extensive clinical and genomic heterogeneity. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) shows promise as a tool for identifying ASD risk genes as well as unreported mutations in known loci, but an assessment of its full utility in an ASD group has not been performed. We used WGS to examine 32 families with ASD to detect de novo or rare inherited genetic variants predicted to be deleterious (loss-of-function and damaging missense mutations). Among ASD probands, we identified deleterious de novo mutations in six of 32 (19%) families and X-linked or autosomal inherited alterations in ten of 32 (31%) families (some had combinations of mutations). The proportion of families identified with such putative mutations was larger than has been previously reported; this yield was in part due to the comprehensive and uniform coverage afforded by WGS. Deleterious variants were found in four unrecognized, nine known, and eight candidate ASD risk genes. Examples include CAPRIN1 and AFF2 (both linked to FMR1, which is involved in fragile X syndrome), VIP (involved in social-cognitive deficits), and other genes such as SCN2A and KCNQ2 (linked to epilepsy), NRXN1, and CHD7, which causes ASD-associated CHARGE syndrome. Taken together, these results suggest that WGS and thorough bioinformatic analyses for de novo and rare inherited mutations will improve the detection of genetic variants likely to be associated with ASD or its accompanying clinical symptoms."

Vismodegib is approved for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The majority of BCC patients treated with vismodegib experience significant clinical benefit, however, a small number of patients develop resistance. Knowledge of resistance mechanisms can generate predictive biomarkers and is critical for the design of additional therapeutic strategies aimed at circumventing resistance. To investigate mechanisms of resistance to vismodegib in BCC we sequenced and profiled biopsies from patients who initially responded to treatment and subsequently progressed on drug.We find that resistance is associated with re-activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway through diverse mechanisms, including concurrent copy number alterations in the downstream Hh pathway components SUFU and GLI2, as well as novel SMO mutations that reduce sensitivity to vismodegib. The latter fall into two classes: those that activate SMO and those that directly affect the vismodegib-binding pocket. Additionally, we observe evidence of clonal selection of SMO mutations and intra-tumor heterogeneity of resistance mechanisms, which implies diverse and combinatorial strategies are required to overcome resistance."
EGAS00001002073,combining transcription factor binding affinities  open chromatin data  accurate gene expression prediction,"The binding and contribution of transcription factors (TF) to cell specific gene expression is often deduced from open-chromatin measurements to avoid cost and labour intensive TF ChIP-seq assays.It is important to develop reliable and fast computational methods for accurate TF binding prediction in open-chromatin regions (OCRs). Here, we report a novel segmentation-based method, TEPIC, to predict TF binding by combining sets of OCRs with position weight matrices.TEPIC can be applied to various open-chromatin data, e.g. DNaseI-seq and NOMe-seq, using either peaks or footprints as input.In addition to open-chromatin data, also Histone-Marks (HMs) can be used in TEPIC to identify candidate TF binding sites.TEPIC computes TF affinities and uses open-chromatin/HM signal intensity as quantitative measures of TF binding strength.Using machine learning techniques, we show that incorporating low affinity binding sites improves our ability to explain gene expression variability compared to the standard presence/absence classification of binding sites.Further, we show that both footprints and peaks capture essential TF binding events and lead to a good prediction performance.In our application, gene-based scores computed by TEPIC with one open-chromatin assay nearly reach the quality of several TF ChIP-seq datasets.Finally, we show that these scores correctly predict known transcriptional regulators as illustrated by the application to novel DNaseI-seq and NOMe-seq data for primary human hepatocytes and CD4+ T-cells, respectively."

Similarly to fusion genes such as PAX3/7-FOXO1, EWSR1/FUS-ETS, SS18-SSX, BRD3/4-NUTM1 or EWSR1/FUS/TAF15-NR4A3 characterizing well-defined entities, we show that all sarcomas displaying CIC fusions- whatever their fusion partner (being DUX4, NUTM1 or FOXO4) - form a transcriptionally homogeneous group of tumors. Likewise, tumors with either a BCOR fusion (with CCNB3, MAML3 or ZC3H7B partners) or with a BCOR internal duplication form a single biological entity. We also found that EML4-ALK fusions also characterize a homogeneous infantile fibrosarcoma subgroup. In contrast, fusions like VGLL2-NCOA2/CITED2, TMP3/TRP-NTRK1 or ETV6-NTRK3 are observed in more heterogeneous tumors.

Nevertheless, their genome remains remarkably stable during life. To increase insight into how these cells can drive tumorigenesis, we set out to determine the genomic integrity of human adult stem cells from patients with liver disease associated with increased cancer risk. To this end, we characterized genome-wide mutation profiles of single ASCs from livers of patients with alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic liver disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis. The patients included in our study received a liver transplant due to their liver disease. Strikingly, we found that ASCs in these livers maintain a stable genome and have comparable mutation rates as healthy human liver ASCs. We did observe more nonsense and nonsynonymous mutations in COSMIC cancer genes that are hit by dominant mutations in tumors in comparison to healthy ASCs (n.s.), including two ASCs in alcoholic liver disease patients with a nonsense mutation in PTPRK. Next, we sequenced 5 biopsies of an alcoholic tumour to identify the mutational patterns in the tumour-initiating ASC. We found that the mutational patterns are, again, similar to healthy liver, but the mutational load is slightly higher. This suggests that the increased cancer risk in the liver disease patients is not caused by an increased mutational load, but rather that the precancerous liver environment promotes outgrowth of cells that would normally be selected against."

understand the drivers of clinical phenotypes better, here we use whole-genome sequencing of tumour and germline
DNA samples from 92 patients with primary refractory, resistant, sensitive and matched acquired resistant disease. We show that gene breakage commonly inactivates the tumour suppressors RB1, NF1, RAD51B and PTEN in HGSC, and contributes to acquired chemotherapy resistance. CCNE1 amplification was common in primary resistant and refractory
disease. We observed several molecular events associated with acquired resistance, including multiple independent
reversions of germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations in individual patients, loss of BRCA1 promoter methylation, an
alteration in molecular subtype, and recurrent promoter fusion associated with overexpression of the drug efflux

EGAS00001002588,systematic kinase inhibitor profiling identifies cdk9   synthetic lethal target  nut midline carcinoma,"Kinase inhibitors represent the backbone of targeted cancer therapy, yet only a limited number of oncogenic drivers are directly druggable. By interrogating the activity of 1,505 kinase inhibitors we found that BRD4-NUT-rearranged NUT midline carcinoma (NMC) cells are specifically killed by CDK9 inhibition (CDK9i) and exhibit a unique dependency on CDK9 and Cyclin-T1 expression. We show that CDK9i leads to robust induction of apoptosis and of markers of DNA damage response in NMC cells. While both CDK9i and bromodomain inhibition over time result in reduced Myc protein expression, only bromodomain inhibition induces cell differentiation and a p21-induced cell cycle arrest in these cells. Finally, RNA-Seq and ChIP-based analyses reveal a BRD4-NUT specific CDK9i-induced perturbation of transcriptional elongation. Thus, our data provide a mechanistic basis for the genotype-dependent vulnerability of NUT midline carcinoma cells to CDK9i that may be of relevance for the development of targeted therapies for NMC patients."

The murine Rb1 gene does not have this retrogene and is not imprinted. We have investigated whether the RB1/Rb1 locus is unique with respect to these differences. For this we have compared the CGIs from human and mouse by in silico analyses and found out that there are at least 2033 human intronic CGIs that are not present in the mouse. Among these CGIs, 104 show sequences similarities elsewhere in the human genome, which suggests that they arose by retrotransposition. We could narrow down the time points when most of these CGIs appeared during evolution. Their methylation status was analysed in two monocyte methylome datasets from whole genome bisulfite sequencing and in 18 published methylomes. Five CGIs appear to be differentially methylated, which suggests that they are subject of genomic imprinting. They are located in introns of the following genes: RB1, ASRGL1, PARP11, PDXDC1 and MYO1D. Four of these CGIs are parts of retrogenes. Our study supports the notion that imprinting builds on host defence mechanisms by which the genome protects itself against retrotransposed and foreign DNA and that the epigenetic fate of the retrotransposed DNA depends on selective forces at the integration site."

The use of these multikinase inhibitors are supported by the observed overactivation of the RET oncoprotein in a large sub-population of medullary thyroid cancers; however, not all patients carry oncogenic alterations of this kinase. Hence, there is a need for molecular characterization of medullary tumors on the genomic scale with the aim of identifying targetable mutations. Here, we describe the genomic profiles of two medullary thyroid cancers and report the presence of a putative oncogenic BRAF fusion in one. Such alterations previously observed in other malignancies and known targets of available drugs, can benefit patients who currently have no therapy options."

To unravel the genetic/epigenetic basis of RMS, we studied 60 RMS cases using whole exome/transcriptome sequencing, copy number (CN) profiling, and DNA methylome analysis. Based on DNA methylation patterns, RMS was clustered into 4 distinct subtypes, which exhibited remarkable correlation with mutation/CN profiles, histological phenotypes, and clinical behaviors. A1 and A2 subtypes, especially A1, largely corresponded to alveolar histology with frequent PAX3/7 fusions and alterations in cell cycle regulators. In contrast, mostly showing embryonal histology, both E1 and E2 subtypes were characterized by high frequency of CN alterations and/or allelic imbalances, FGFR4/RAS/AKT pathway mutations and PTEN mutations/methylation and in E2, also by p53 inactivation. Despite generally poor prognosis in RMS, patients in E1 cluster exceptionally showed excellent prognosis. Our results highlight the close relationship between DNA methylation status and gene mutations and biological behavior in RMS."

However, they do not lead to cures, and, on average, relapse occurs typically occurs afterafter an average of one year of continuous treatment.  In a subset of patients, aA fundamental histological transformation from NSCLC to small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is observed in a subset of the resistant cancers, but the molecular changes associated with this transformation remain unknown. Analysis of a cohort of tumor samples and cell lines derived from resistant EGFR mutant patients with SCLC transformation revealed that RB is lost in 100% of these SCLC transformed cases, but rarely in those that remain NSCLC.  Global changes in gene expression, including increased neuroendocrine marker expression and absence of EGFR expression, are observed in resistant EGFR mutant cancers that transformed to SCLC.  Consistent Further, with their similarities to classical SCLC at the genetic and gene expression levelincreased neuroendocrine marker and decreased EGFR expression as well as greater sensitivity to BCL2 family inhibition are observed in resistant SCLC transformed cancers compared to resistant NSCLCs. , cell lines derived from resistant EGFR mutant SCLC biopsies are substantially more sensitive to Bcl-2 family inhibition with ABT-263 compared to those derived from resistant EGFR mutant NSCLCs.  Together, these findings suggest that despite developing initially as EGFR mutant adenocarcinomas, this subset of resistant cancers ultimately adopt many of the molecular and phenotypic characteristics of classical SCLC."

Imprinted genes are involved in the etiology of rare syndromes and have been associated with common diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Standard RNA bulk cell sequencing applied to whole tissue samples has been used to detect imprinted genes in human and mouse models. However, lowly expressed genes cannot be detected by using RNA bulk approaches. Here, we report an original and robust method that combines single-cell RNAseq and whole genome sequencing into an optimized statistical framework to analyze genomic imprinting in specific cell-types and in different individuals. Using samples from the probands of 2 family trios and 3 unrelated individuals, 1084 individual primary fibroblasts were RNA sequenced, and more than 700000 informative heterozygous single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were genotyped. The allele specific coverage per gene of each SNV in each single cell was used to fit a beta-binomial distribution to model the likelihood of a gene being expressed from one and the same allele. Genes presenting a significant aggregate allelic ratio (between 0.9-1) were retained to identify of the allelic parent of origin. Our approach allowed us to validate the imprinting status of all of the known imprinted genes expressed in fibroblasts and the discovery of 9 putative imprinted genes, thus demonstrating the advantages of single-cell over bulk RNAseq to identify imprinted genes. The proposed single-cell methodology is a powerful tool for establishing a cell type-specific map of genomic imprinting."
EGAS00001001051,methylation differences  trisomy 21  monozygotic twins,"We have hypothesized that methylation differences induced by trisomy 21 (T21) contribute to the phenotypic characteristics and heterogeneity in T21. In order to determine the methylation differences in T21 without the interference of the interindividual genomic variation, we have used fetal skin fibroblasts from monozygotic (MZ) twins discordant for T21. We also used skin fibroblasts from MZ twins concordant for T21, normal MZ twins without T21, and unrelated normal and T21 individuals. We applied Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) to generate genome wide nucleotide resolution of DNA methylation based on high throughput sequencing between each pair of samples. RRBS revealed differentially methylated promoter regions (DMRs) in MZ twins discordant for T21 that have also been observed in unrelated normal and T21 individuals. The identified DMRs are enriched for genes involved in embryonic organ morphogenesis. These DMRs are maintained in iPS cells generated from this twin pair and are correlated with the gene expression changes. We have also observed an increase in DNA methylation level in the T21 methylome compared to the normal euploid methylome. This observation is concordant with the up regulation of DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMT3B and DNMT3L) and down regulation of DNA demethylation enzymes (TET2 and TET3) in the iPSC of the T21 versus normal twin. Additionally, two sets of T21 MZ twins discordant for heart defect highlighted DMRs in genes that are associated with heart development. In conclusion the study of DNA methylation differences in MZ twins discordant for genomic abnormalities is a promising approach to understand the molecular pathophysiology of aneuploidies."

While relapse-specific mutations are sometimes detected at low frequency within bulk diagnosis samples, the cell type giving rise to relapse is unknown. Through combined genetic and functional analysis of purified subpopulations and xenografts from paired diagnosis/relapse samples, we identified two major patterns of relapse arising from therapy-resistant cells already present at diagnosis. In some cases relapse originated from rare leukemia stem cells with a primitive immunophenotype, while in other instances relapse developed from larger subclones of immunophenotypically-committed cells that retained strong stemness transcriptional signatures. The identification of distinct patterns of relapse should lead to improved methods for disease management and monitoring in AML. Moreover, the shared functional and transcriptional stemness properties that underlie both cellular origins of relapse underscore the importance of developing new therapeutic approaches that target stemness to prevent relapse."

We aimed to apply an extreme sampling method to enhance the statistical power to identify novel genetic risk variants for CHD in individuals with FH.  We selected cases and controls with an extreme contrast in CHD risk from 17 000 FH patients from the Netherlands, whose functional LDLR mutation was unequivocally established. The genome-wide association (GWA) study was performed on 249 very young FH cases with CHD and 217 old FH controls without CHD (above 65 years for males and 70 years of age for females) using the Illumina HumanHap 550K chip. In the next stage, two independent samples (one from the Netherlands and one from Italy, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom) of FH patients were used as replication samples. In the initial GWA analysis we identified 29 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with suggestive associations with premature CHD (p&lt;1×10-4). We examined the association of these SNPs with CHD risk in the replication samples. After Bonferroni correction, none of the SNPs either replicated or reached genome-wide significance after combining the discovery and replication samples.  Therefore, we conclude that the genetics of CHD risk in FH is complex and even applying an ‘extreme genetics’ approach we did not identify new genetic risk variants. Most likely, this method is not as effective in leveraging effect size as anticipated, and may therefore not lead to significant gains in statistical power.

Clinical evolution is heterogeneous, with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation in 1/3 of cases and frequent relapses after hematopoietic-stem-cell transplantation (HSCT), although some patients experience spontaneous remission (Locatelli, Nollke et al. 2005; Matsuda, Shimada et al. 2007; Takagi, Piao et al. 2013; Locatelli and Niemeyer 2015). The initiating lesion incompletely predicts outcome, suggesting the involvement of additional mutations. Genetic profiling of a large JMML cohort (n=118), including whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 30 cases, uncovered additional genetic abnormalities in 56 cases (47%). Somatic events were rare (0.38/case/Mb) and restricted to sporadic (47/78; 60%) or NF1-associated (8/8; 100%) JMML. Multiple concomitant genetic hits were identified targeting the RAS pathway in 13/78 (17%), RAC2D63V, which activates the PI3K/PDK1/AKT and the mTORC2 pathways, and a novel pathway for JMML, the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), in 26/78 (33%) of the sporadic JMML cases. Interestingly, PRC2 imbalance was recently shown to synergize with RAS activation (De Raedt, Beert et al. 2014). JMML outcome was associated to the mutational profile, suggesting a dose-dependent effect for RAS-pathway activation, distinguishing very aggressive JMML rapidly progressing to AML."

In late stage CRC, the most commonly used targeted therapies are monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab, which inactivate EGFR.  Recent studies have identified alterations in KRAS and other genes as likely mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance to anti-EGFR antibody therapy.  Despite these efforts, additional mechanisms of resistance to EGFR blockade are thought to be present in CRC and little is known about determinants of sensitivity to this therapy.  To examine the effect of somatic genetic changes in CRC on response to anti-EGFR antibody therapy, we performed complete exome sequence and copy number analyses of 129 patient-derived tumorgrafts and targeted genomic analyses of 55 patient tumors, all of which were KRAS wild-type.  We analyzed the response of tumors to anti-EGFR antibody blockade in tumorgraft models or in clinical settings.  In addition to previously identified genes, we detected mutations in ERBB2, EGFR, FGFR1, PDGFRA, and MAP2K1 as potential mechanisms of primary resistance to this therapy.  Novel alterations in the ectodomain of EGFR were identified in patients with acquired resistance to EGFR blockade.  Amplifications and sequence changes in the tyrosine kinase receptor adaptor gene IRS2 were identified in tumors with increased sensitivity to anti-EGFR therapy.  Therapeutic resistance to EGFR blockade could be overcome in tumorgraft models through combinatorial therapies targeting actionable genes.  These analyses provide a systematic approach to evaluate response to targeted therapies in human cancer, highlight new mechanisms of responsiveness to anti-EGFR therapies, and provide new avenues for intervention in the management of CRC."

The mutational burden significantly increased in relapsing tumors accompanied by altered mutational signatures and reduced subclonal heterogeneity. Global allele frequencies at relapse indicated clonal mutation selection during disease progression. Promoter methylation patterns were consistent over disease course and patient-specific. Recurrent alterations at relapse included mutations in the putative CHD5 neuroblastoma tumor suppressor, chromosome 9p losses, DOCK8 mutations, inactivating mutations in PTPN14 and a relapse-specific activity pattern for the PTPN14 target gene, YAP. Recurrent new mutations in HRAS, KRAS, DOCK8 and genes mediating cell-cell interaction in 13/16 relapse tumors also indicate disturbances in signaling pathways mediating mesenchymal transition.

EGAS00001000067,samples   greek island  crete manolis cohort,"Genome-wide association studies of complex traits have been successful in identifying common variant associations, but a substantial heritability gap remains. The field of complex trait genetics is shifting towards the study of low frequency and rare variants, which are hypothesised to have larger effects. The study of these variants can be empowered by focusing on isolated populations, in which rare variants may have increased in frequency and linkage disequilibrium tends to be extended. This work focuses on isolated populations from Greece. Sequencing is very efficient in isolated populations, because variants found in a few samples will be shared by others in extended haplotype contexts, supporting accurate imputation."
EGAS00001002615, transgenerational mmachc epimutation illustrates   mechanism  inborn errors  metabolism,"Up to now, the epimutations reported in man have been somatic, without germlinetransmission. We report the transgenerational transmission of a constitutional epimutation inthe cblC class of inborn error of vitamin B12 metabolism that we named epi-cblC. Subjectscarry, in trans, a heterozygous MMACHC mutation and a promoter epimutation, detectable inblood, fibroblasts and sperm; the epimutation was transmitted through three generations. 5-Azacytidine restored the MMACHC expression in fibroblasts. MMACHC is flanked byCCDC163P and PRDX1, which are in the opposite orientation. Genome-wide sequencingidentified PRDX1 mutations that forced antisense transcription of MMACHC, resulting in aH3K36me3 mark in the promoter. The silencing of PRDX1 transcription produced a partialhypomethylation of the epiallele and restored the expression of MMCHC. The example of epicblC shows the need to look for compound epigenetic/genetic heterozygosity in patients with typical disease manifestation and genetic heterozygosity in disease-causing genes located in other gene trios."

EGAS00001001308,telomerase activation  genomic rearrangements  high risk neuroblastoma,"Neuroblastoma is a malignant pediatric tumor of the sympathetic nervous system1. Roughly half of these tumors regress spontaneously or are cured by limited therapy. By contrast, high-risk neuroblastomas have an unfavorable clinical course despite intensive multimodal treatment, and their molecular basis has remained largely elusive2-4. We have performed whole-genome sequencing of 56 neuroblastomas (high-risk, n=39; low-risk, n=17) and discovered recurrent genomic rearrangements affecting a chromosomal region (5p15.22) proximal of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT). These rearrangements occurred only in high-risk neuroblastomas (12/39, 31%) in mutually exclusive fashion with MYCN amplifications and ATRX mutations, which are known genetic events in this tumor type1,2,5. In an extended case series (n=217), TERT rearrangements defined a subgroup of high-risk tumors with particularly poor outcome. Despite the large diversity of these rearrangements, they all induced massive transcriptional upregulation of TERT. In the remaining high-risk tumors, TERT expression was also elevated in MYCN-amplified tumors, whereas alternative lengthening of telomeres was present in neuroblastomas without TERT or MYCN alterations, suggesting that telomere lengthening represents a central mechanism defining this subtype. The 5p15.22 rearrangements juxtapose the TERT coding sequence to strong enhancer elements, resulting in massive chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation of the affected region. Supporting a functional role of TERT, neuroblastoma cells bearing rearrangements or amplified MYCN exhibited both upregulated TERT expression and enzymatic telomerase activity. In summary, our findings show that remodeling of the genomic context abrogates transcriptional silencing of TERT in high-risk neuroblastoma and places telomerase activation in the center of transformation in a large fraction of these tumors."

We generated genomic data for 1,318 individuals from 35 populations in western central Africa, where Bantu languages originated. We found that early Bantu speakers first moved southward, through the equatorial rainforest, before spreading toward eastern and southern Africa. We also found that genetic adaptation of Bantu speakers was facilitated by admixture with autochthonous populations, particularly for the HLA and LCT loci. Finally, we identified a major contribution of western central African Bantu speakers to the ancestry of African Americans, whose genomes present no strong signals of natural selection. Together, these results highlight the contribution of Bantu-speaking peoples to the complex genetic history of Africans and African Americans."

However, clonal tumor expansion from complex normal tissue architectures potentially obscures cancer-specific events, including divergent epigenetic patterns. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of normal B cell subsets, we observed broad epigenetic programming of selective transcription factor binding sites coincident with the degree of B cell maturation. By comparing normal B cells to malignant B cells from 268 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we showed that tumors derive largely from a continuum of maturation states reflected in normal developmental stages. Epigenetic maturation in CLL was associated with an indolent gene expression pattern and increasingly favorable clinical outcomes.As second study using these samples focued on evolution and resulting intra-tumor heterogeneity in CLL. We used 450k bead-chip arrays to study DNA methylomes in 68 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cases, including 28 serial cases. The result establishs linked evolution of epigenetic and genetic alterations in progressive disease, revealing an important aspect of the biology of epigenetics in cancer."

However, aspirin is associated with a significant incidence of upper gastrointestinal (GI) complications, notably peptic ulceration.  This study aims to identify genetic risk factors associated with the pathogenesis of aspirin-induced upper GI ulceration.A cohort of 248 patients with aspirin-induced, endoscopiclly confirmed GI ulceration and 491 controls (ulcer, without aspirin or aspirin without ulcer) were genotyped for 1.524,956 SNPs using the Illumina Omni 2.5 SNP array.  A replication cohort (206 NSAID-induced ulcer cases [of which 87 were aspirin] and 309 controls) was subsequently genotyped for identified SNP association signals using Sequenom iPLEX Massarry.  Logistic regression analysis of identified two SNP signal with suggestive association with aspirin-induced GI ulceration.  A SNP within the EYA1 locus (rs12678747) was found to be associated with aspirin GI ulceration in both the discovery cohort (p=3.79x10-7, OR=2.06 ([1.55-2.73]) and, to a lesser extent, in the replication cohort (p=.0005, OR=1.71[1.17-2.50].  Combined analysis of both cohorts yielded a genome wide significant association (p=1.46x10-8). The rs12678747 genotype was found to be associated with significantly higher EYA1 transcript in ulcer biopsy tissue (p&lt;0.05).Data suggest that EYA1 may represent a risk locus for aspirin-induced GI ulceration.

However, to a specific field, time-series clinical and genetic data of one patient need to be fed into study therefore the potential causal connection could be evidenced on molecular level. In this study, we performed whole exome analysis on a panel of samples from one rare patient who had both independent dcis and idc lesions on her left breast. This panel indeed provides us a precious opportunity of precisely shooting few genetic variances evolutionarily drove invasion of cancer cells, and consequently lead to a bad prognosis. In this case, at first we identified that VEGF pathway were genetically disturbed in dcis sample. Interestingly, in idc sample, four more genes in such pathway were observed being mutated, in which mutated ACTN2 were found in seven samples in TCGA breast patients. We report here that those patients with somatically mutated ACTN2 are statistically with shorted Overall survival time (p &lt; 0.05), evidencing that (1) driver gene was identified and (2) one patient panel provides a sharpen tool of genetically providing explanations for cancer development."

EGAS00001001294,transcriptome human nasal epithelium,"1. Odors are detected, firstly, by olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in the olfactory epithelium of the nose. This neurons then project directly to the olfactory bulb in the brain. Olfaction depends on cellular regeneration of the OE, olfactory bulb and hippocampus, and on their continual re-wiring. The olfactory neural pathway includes regions of the frontal, temporal and limbic brain, which in turn overlap with brain areas involved in brain disorders. OSNs are the only aspect of the human brain exposed to the external environment. This not only makes them vulnerable to environmental changes, but also accessible for biomedical studies.We have already sequenced and developed a protocol for analyzing the transcriptome of mouse main olfactory epithelium and single OSNs. We propose here to perform a similar study for samples from the human olfactory epithelium. We have developed a minimally invasive method for obtaining human OSNs, among other cells from the nasal epithelium. In this experiment, we have obtained cell samples from the olfactory epithelium, including OSN, from healthy volunteers. We would like to further characterize them by RNA sequencing. This will give us valuable insight into human olfaction. It will also provide a first step into a new avenue to study, and find biomarkers for, brain diseases though the analysis of these easily available neurons.

We will also perform the six assays twice within a culture derived from the same colony to assess the technical variability of our assays. Each colony will be screened by array CGH during passages 3-5 to remove colonies with very large deletions of rearrangements prior to culture. The assays we will perform are: FAIRE (formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements)-seq (chromatin openness), ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation)-seq for H3K4me3 (active promoters), ChIP-seq for H3K27ac (active enhancers) ChIP-seq for H3K27me3 (silent &amp; bivalent promoters, enhancers) and RNA-seq (transcription). By mapping reads to different alleles, we will be able to identify allele-specific effects on epigenetic marks and chromatin accessibility.FAIRE material is generated from cells or tissue that are cross-linked briefly with formaldehyde, lysed and sonicated. Sheared chromatin is subject to phenol/chloroform extraction.

Despite its relatively low recurrence risk, this subgroup generates a high proportion of relapses. The cause and origin of these relapses remains obscure. We therefore explored the mutational landscape in high hyperdiploid (HD) ALL with whole-exome (n=19) and subsequent targeted deep sequencing of 60 genes in 100 relapsing and 51 non-relapsing cases. We identified multiple clones at diagnosis that were primarily defined by a variety of mutations in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/Ras pathway and chromatin-modifying genes. The relapse clones consisted of reappearing as well as new mutations, and overall contained more mutations. Although RTK/Ras pathway mutations were similarly frequent between diagnosis and relapse, both intergenic and intragenic heterogeneity was essentially lost at relapse. CREBBP mutations, however, increased from initially 18-30% at relapse, then commonly co-occurred with KRAS mutations (P&lt;0.001) and these relapses appeared primarily early (P=0.012). Our results confirm the exceptional susceptibility of HD ALL to RTK/Ras pathway and CREBBP mutations, but, more importantly, suggest that mutant KRAS and CREBBP might cooperate and equip cells with the necessary capacity to evolve into a relapse-generating clone."

These cases are characterized by expression of a ERG transcript that utilizes a novel exon in intron 6 of ERG spliced to the canonical reading frame of ERG exons 7-10, encoding a 27 kDa C-terminal ERG protein that retains the ETS and transactivating domains but lacks the N-terminal pointed and regulatory domains. This protein is a competitive inhibitor of wild-type ERG and is leukemogenic in vivo. ERG-altered ALL cases have a favourable outcome despite the presence of alterations associated with poor prognosis in non-ERG ALL, such as deletions of IKZF1. These findings identify a new subtype of leukemia characterized by a novel mechanism of ETS transcription factor dysregulation in cancer."

We show that the ancestors of some pairs of present-day human populations were substantially separated by 100,000 years ago, well before the archaeologically attested onset of behavioural modernity. We also demonstrate that indigenous Australians, New Guineans and Andamanese do not derive substantial ancestry from an early dispersal of modern humans; instead, their modern human ancestry is consistent with coming from the same source as that in other non- Africans."

We used whole-genome sequencing to fully characterize 14 BRCA2-mutant PCa and demonstrate that BRCA2-mutant PCa is associated with increased genetic instability and a mutually exclusive mutational burden when compared to sporadic PCa. Importantly, BRCA2-mutated cancers are defined by unique copy number gains and hypomethylation events, including alterations in the MED12L/MED12 axis, which are found solely in mCRPC and are enriched in PCa tumours harbouring aggressive intraductal carcinoma (IDC-P) pathologic sub-types. Our findings begin to explain the clinical entity of BRCA2-mutated PCa as these tumours have a unique and aggressive genotype de novo, associated with IDC-P and mCRPC, even in the hormone-naive setting."

EGAS00001002065,similarity  diversity   tumor microenvironment  multiple metastases critical implications    progression free survival  high grade serous ovarian cancer,"The tumor microenvironment is pivotal in influencing cancer progression and metastasis. Different cells co-exist with high spatial diversity within a patient, yet their combinatorial effects are poorly understood. We investigate the similarity of the tumor microenvironment of 192 local metastatic lesions in 61 ovarian cancer patients. An ecologically inspired measure of microenvironmental diversity derived from multiple metastasis sites is correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic outcome. We demonstrate a high accuracy of our automated analysis across multiple sites. A low level of similarity in microenvironmental composition is observed between ovary tumor and corresponding local metastases (stromal ratio r = 0.30, lymphocyte ratio r = 0.37). We identify a new measure of microenvironmental diversity derived from Shannon entropy that is highly predictive of poor overall (p = 0.002, HR = 3.18, 95% CI = 1.51-6.68) and progression-free survival (p = 0.0036, HR = 2.83, 95% CI = 1.41-5.7), independent of and stronger than clinical variables, subtype stratifications based on single cell types alone and number of sites. Although stromal influence in ovary tumors is known to have significant clinical implications, our findings reveal an even stronger impact orchestrated by diverse cell types. Quantitative histology-based measures can further enable objective selection of patients who are in urgent need of new therapeutic strategies such as combinatorial treatments targeting heterogeneous tumor microenvironment."

Here, we characterized, using RNA-sequencing, the transcriptional response of primary monocytes from Africans and Europeans to bacterial and viral stimuli - ligands activating Toll-like receptors pathways (TLR1/2, TLR4 and TLR7/8) and influenza virus - and mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). We identify multiple cis- and trans-eQTL that contribute to the marked differences in immune responses detected within and between populations, including a TLR1 master regulator that decreases expression of pro-inflammatory genes in Europeans only. We show that regulatory variants have been privileged targets of natural selection, uncovering evolutionarily advantageous mechanisms, such as attenuated inflammation. Finally, we demonstrate that admixture with Neandertals introduced regulatory variants into European genomes, affecting preferentially responses to viral challenges, and identify archaic haplotypes that contributed to population genetic adaptation."

Genetic association analyses demonstrate that the alterations in DNA methylation are predominantly the consequence of adiposity, rather than the cause. We find the methylation loci are enriched for functional genomic features in multiple tissues (P&lt;0.05), and show that sentinel methylation markers identify gene expression signatures at 38 loci (P&lt;9.0x10-6, range P=5.5x10-6 to 6.1x10-35, N=1,785 samples). The methylation loci identified highlight genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, substrate transport, and inflammatory pathways. Finally, we show that the disturbances in DNA methylation predict future type-2 diabetes (relative risk per 1SD increase in Methylation Risk Score: 2.3 [2.07-2.56]; P=1.1x10-54). Our results provide new insights into the biologic pathways influenced by adiposity, and may enable development of new strategies for prediction and prevention of type-2 diabetes and other adverse clinical consequences of obesity."

Examination of an extended cohort of 1164 B-ALL cases identified 30 cases with MEF2D rearrangements which include an additional fusion partner, FOXJ2, thus MEF2D-rearranged cases comprise 5.3% of cases lacking recurring alterations. MEF2D-rearranged ALL is characterized by a distinct immunophenotype, DNA copy number alterations at the rearrangement sites, older diagnosis age, and poor outcome. The rearrangements result in enhanced MEF2D transcriptional activity, lymphoid transformation, activation of HDAC9 expression and sensitive to histone deacetylase inhibitors treatment. Thus, MEF2D-rearranged ALL represents a distinct form of high-risk leukemia, for which new therapeutic approaches should be considered."

EGAS00001002267,accurate genomic variant characterisation  phasing  calling   genome sequencing  picogram quantities  dna,"Minimal residual disease (MRD) following cancer therapy predisposes to recurrence. Genome analysis of MRD could therefore give insights into evolutionary mechanisms that might govern this phenomenon [27492892]. However, to-date, this has largely been restricted to studies utilizing targeted sequencing [26311728, 27384348] of known somatic mutations due to the challenges of sampling residual cells and whole genome sequencing of sub-nanogram quantities of DNA. Whole genome sequencing of sub-nanogram quantities, although possible, is inherently confounded by genomic amplification bias. A previous report suggested that accurate whole genome sequencing is possible from as little as 10 to 20 cells with the added advantage of obtaining reconstructed long fragment reads and, therefore, phase information [22785314]. However, the ability of this technique to estimate accurate variant allele fractions (VAFs) to enable the identification of somatic chromosomal numeric aberrations (SCNAs) in tumours remains to be determined. In addition, the platform that was used to generate such data is no longer available for general use. Here we implemented a modified protocol to generate synthetic long fragment read whole genome sequencing data using Illumina sequencing technology. Our method differs from the pre-existing TruSeq/Moleculo sequencing approach [24561555] in that it is based on compartmentalization of picogram quantities of starting DNA material (Figure 1A). Barcoding of individual wells enables obtaining a digital count of the number of wells that contained any particular allele. We hypothesized that this digital analysis of picogram quantities of DNA (DigiPico), would yield an accurate estimate of VAFs and, therefore, accurate calling of SCNAs."

Here we identify DONSON as a novel fork protection factor, and report biallelic DONSON mutations in 29 individuals with microcephalic dwarfism. We demonstrate that DONSON is a component of the replisome that stabilises forks during normal genome replication. Loss of DONSON leads to severe replication-associated DNA damage arising from nucleolytic cleavage of stalled replication forks. Furthermore, ATR-dependent signalling in response to replication stress is impaired in DONSON-deficient cells, resulting in decreased checkpoint activity, and potentiating chromosomal instability. Hypomorphic mutations substantially reduce DONSON protein levels and impair fork stability in patient cells, consistent with defective DNA replication underlying the disease phenotype. In summary, we identify mutations in DONSON as a common cause of microcephalic dwarfism, and establish DONSON as a critical replication fork protein required for mammalian DNA replication and genome stability."

EGAS00001001801,comparing nodal versus bony metastatic spread  tumour phylogenies,"The role of lymph node metastases in distant prostate cancer dissemination and lethality is ill defined. Patients with metastases restricted to lymph nodes have a better prognosis than those with distant metastatic spread, suggesting the possibility of distinct aetiologies. To explore this, we traced patterns of cancer dissemination using tumour phylogenies inferred from genome-wide copy-number profiling of 48 samples across 3 patients with lymph node metastatic disease and 3 patients with osseous metastatic disease. Our results show that metastatic cells in regional lymph nodes originate from evolutionary advanced extra-prostatic tumour cells rather than less advanced central tumour cell populations. In contrast, osseous metastases do not exhibit such a constrained developmental lineage, arising from either intra or extra-prostatic tumour cell populations, at early and late stages in the evolution of the primary. Collectively, this comparison suggests that lymph node metastases may not be an intermediate developmental step for distant osseous metastases, but rather represent a distinct metastatic lineage."

We use human genome-wide genotyping arrays and new whole-genome HCV viral sequencing technologies to perform a systematic genome-to-genome study of 542 individuals chronically infected with HCV, predominately genotype 3. We show that both HLA alleles and interferon lambda innate immune system genes drive viral genome polymorphism, and that IFNL4 genotypes determine HCV viral load through a mechanism that is dependent on a specific polymorphism in the HCV polyprotein. We highlight the interplay between innate immune responses and the viral genome in HCV control."

Candidate immunologic markers and gene expression were assessed in ten cutaneous metastases showing response or progression during therapy.Results:  The melanoma was driven by biallelic inactivation of NF1.  All lesions had highly concordant mutational profiles and copy number alterations, indicating linear clonal evolution.  Expression of candidate immunologic markers was similar in responding and progressing lesions. However, progressing cutaneous metastases were associated with over-expression of genes associated with extracellular matrix and neutrophil function.Conclusions:  Although mutational and immunologic differences have been proposed as the primary determinants of heterogeneous response/resistance to targeted therapies and immunotherapies, respectively,  differential lesional gene expression profiles may also dictate anti-PD-1 outcomes."

The vast majority of thesepeople will not have noticed any symptoms, however about 10% of people develop a mild to moderate self limitingflu-like illness. Following the acute active stage of the infection the parasite persists in the body in the form of cysts,particularly in heart and skeletal muscle and nervous system tissues, for many years, and usually for life.

Previously, we have demonstrated genomic ITH in localized lung adenocarcinomas; however, the nature of methylation ITH in lung cancers has not been well investigated. In this study, we generated methylation profiles of 48 spatially separated tumor regions from 11 localized lung adenocarcinomas and their matched normal lung tissues using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450K BeadChip array. We observed methylation ITH within the same tumors, but to a much less extent compared to inter-individual heterogeneity. On average, 25% of all differentially methylated probes compared to matched normal lung tissues were shared by all regions from the same tumors. This is in contrast to somatic mutations, of which approximately 77% were shared events amongst all regions of individual tumors, suggesting that while the majority of somatic mutations were early clonal events, the tumor-specific DNA methylation might be associated with later branched evolution of these 11 tumors. Furthermore, our data showed that a higher extent of DNA methylation ITH was associated with larger tumor size, advanced age and increased risk of postsurgical recurrence."

Comprehensive genetic diagnosis is needed to match each patient to appropriate cancer therapy. However, acquisition of representative tumor samples is invasive and often infeasible. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a promising non-invasive biomarker for cancer mutational profiling. Here we implemented targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) with a customized pan-cancer gene panel on 605 clinical ctDNA samples in multiple cancer types. Overall, tumor-specific mutations were identified in 87% of ctDNA samples, with mutation spectra highly concordant with their matched tumor tissues. 71% of patients have at least one clinical actionable mutation with 76% of which have suggested drugs approved or in clinical trials. In particular, our study reveals a unique mutation spectrum in Chinese lung cancer patients, which could be used to guide treatment decision and monitor the appearance of drug-resistant mutations. Taken together, our study demonstrated the clinical utility of target NGS-based ctDNA mutational profiling to guide cancer treatment decision."
EGAS00001000819,exploring mutational signatures  dna damage  repair processes,"DNA in all cells is prone to mutagenesis, with somatic mutations making key contributions to various human diseases such as cancer and to aging itself. Mutations may be the consequence of endogenous or exogenous mutagenic influences (such as radiation and DNA-damaging chemicals), and also result from the intrinsic infidelity of DNA replication or enzymatic DNA modifications. The damage associated with generating somatic mutations is generally mitigated by the cellular DNA repair machinery, and defective functioning of components of this machinery can markedly increase mutation rates. Different mutational processes leave different, characteristic signatures of somatic mutations on the exposed cellular genome. Mutational signatures include one or more classes of DNA change; base substitutions, insertions and deletions, rearrangements and copy number changes. Notably, recent analyses of cancer genomes have revealed several novel mutational signatures, the biological bases of which are predominantly unknown.To elucidate somatic mutational processes operative in cells, in particular their influences on human disease, we propose to systematically survey the mutational signatures generated by exposures to known DNA damaging agents and defective DNA repair/editing processes. These studies will provide a series of mutational signatures with known underlying causes for subsequent matching to signatures found in normal or diseased human cells, and will explore how various cellular components influence mutagenesis. Mutational signatures extracted in this study will be characterised by next generation sequencing of whole genomes of cell clones that have been exposed to a mutational process caused by DNA damaging agents or abnormalities in DNA repair/editing."

We investigated how to minimize the limit of ITH for profiling hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods: Thirty-two multi-regional HCC samples from five patients were subjected to whole exome sequencing (WES) and targeted deep sequencing (TDS). ITH extent was measured by the average percentage of non-ubiquitous mutations (present in parts of tumor regions). Matched cfDNAs were also analyzed by WES and TDS. Profiling efficiencies of single tumor specimen and cfDNA were compared and the one better depicted mutational landscape was selected to screen therapeutic targets.Results: We found variable extents of ITH in HCCs and observed branched and parallel evolution patterns. ITH level decreased at higher sequencing depth of TDS than that measured by WES (28.1% vs 34.9%, P &lt; 0.01) but it remained unchanged upon additional samples analyzed. TDS of single tumor specimen detected an average of 70% the total mutations in HCC. Although more mutations were detected in cfDNA under TDS than WES, an average of 47.2% total HCC mutations uncovered by cfDNA suggested tissue outperform cfDNA and the latter may serve as alternative in profiling HCC genome. Consequently, TDS of single tumor tissue in 66 patients and cfDNAs in four unresectable HCCs identified 38.6% (26/66 and 1/4) patients bearing therapeutic targets.Conclusions: TDS of single tumor specimen could largely circumvent ITH to uncover mutations indicative of target therapy in HCC."
EGAS00001003288,mutated h3 histones drive human pre leukemic hematopoietic stem cell expansion  promote leukemic aggressiveness,"Leukemogenesis is a stepwise progression from mutated, pre-neoplastic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to full-blown leukemia. Our ability to prevent or treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is limited by our incomplete understanding of the epigenetic disruption that is central to this process, including improper histone methylation. Comprehensive analysis of 16 histone H3 genes in 434 primary AML samples identified Q69H, A26P, R2Q, R8H and K27M/I mutations (1.6%), and a higher incidence in secondary AML (s-AML) (9%). We establish that these mutations are important early events in leukemogenesis. They occur in pre-leukemic HSCs, increase the frequency of functional human HSCs, and alter differentiation. The mutations are present in the major leukemic clones in primary samples, and the mutant histones amplify leukemic aggressiveness with increased proliferation, expansion of leukemic progenitor and blast cells, and superior competitiveness in vivo. These effects are dependent on the specific mutation. Genome-wide analysis of K27 mutants revealed increased expression of genes involved in erythrocyte and myeloid differentiation with a corresponding decrease in histone H3 K27 tri-methylation and increase in K27 acetylation. The functional impact of histone mutations is independent of RUNX1 mutations, although they can co-occur. These data establish the involvement of H3 mutations as initial drivers of pre-cancerous stem cell expansion and leukemogenesis."

Transcription-coupled damage was specifically associated with the liver-specific signature 16 and alcohol intake. Flood of indels were identified in very highly expressed hepato-specific genes, likely resulting from replication-transcription collisions.

EGAS00001002344, genome sequencing suggests schizophrenia risk mechanisms  humans  22q11 2 deletion syndrome,"Chromosome 22q11.2 microdeletions impart a high but incomplete risk for schizophrenia. Possible mechanisms include genome-wide effects of DGCR8 haploinsufficiency. In a proof-of-principle study to assess the power of this model, we used high-quality, whole-genome sequencing of nine individuals with 22q11.2 deletions and extreme phenotypes (schizophrenia, or no psychotic disorder at age &gt;50 years). The schizophrenia group had a greater burden of rare, damaging variants impacting protein-coding neurofunctional genes, including genes involved in neuron projection (nominal P = 0.02, joint burden of three variant types). Variants in the intact 22q11.2 region were not major contributors. Restricting to genes affected by a DGCR8 mechanism tended to amplify between-group differences. Damaging variants in highly conserved long intergenic noncoding RNA genes also were enriched in the schizophrenia group (nominal P = 0.04). The findings support the 22q11.2 deletion model as a threshold-lowering first hit for schizophrenia risk. If applied to a larger and thus better-powered cohort, this appears to be a promising approach to identify genome-wide rare variants in coding and noncoding sequence that perturb gene networks relevant to idiopathic schizophrenia. Similarly designed studies exploiting genetic models may prove useful to help delineate the genetic architecture of other complex phenotypes."
EGAS00001000887,subclonal diversification  primary breast cancer,"Cancers are ecosystems of genetically related clones, competing across space and time for limited resources. To understand the clonal structure of primary breast cancer, we applied genome and targeted sequencing to 295 samples from 49 patients’ tumors. The extent of subclonal diversification varied considerably among patients and encompassed many spatial patterns, including local growth, intraductal dissemination and clonal intermixture. Landmarks of disease progression, such as acquiring invasive or metastatic potential, arose within detectable subclones of antecedent lesions, suggesting that subclonal mutations could be relevant if actionable. No defined temporal order of mutation was evident, with the commonest genes, including PIK3CA, TP53, BRCA2, PTEN and MYC, mutated early in some, late in others, often exhibiting parallel evolution across subclones. Signatures of homologous recombination deficiency correlated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Thus, the interplay of mutation, growth and competition drives clonal structures of breast cancer that are complex, variable across patients and clinically relevant."
EGAS00001002424,cell fate mapping  human glioblastoma reveals  invariant stem cell hierarchy pre  post treatment,"Human glioblastomas (GBMs) are thought to harbour a subpopulation of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) that initiate tumour formation and regrowth following treatment. However, the origin of their proliferative heterogeneity during tumour growth pre- and post-treatment remains poorly understood. Here we  study the clonal evolution of DNA barcoded GBMs following their serial propagation in xenograft mouse models to define the fate behaviour of individual GBM cells. Through quantitative analysis of clone sizes scored across multiple passages, we show that the growth of GBM clones in vivo are consistent with a remarkably neutral process resulting from a conserved proliferative hierarchy. In this model, slow-cycling stem-like cells give rise to a more rapidly cycling progenitor population with extensive self-maintenance capacity, that in turn generates short-lived cells that lack proliferative ability. We also identify rare ""outlier"" clones that deviate from these dynamics, and further show that chemotherapy reproducibly facilitates the selective expansion of pre-existing drug-resistant GBM lineages. Finally, we show that coexisting, functionally distinct GSCs may be targeted separately with epigenetic compounds. These findings show that, independent of an evolving mutational signature, the clonal dynamics of human GBM can be surprisingly robust, with intratumoural heterogeneity derived primarily from the defined stochastic fate behaviour of tumour cells within a conserved proliferative hierarchy."
EGAS00001002390,genomic consequences  aberrant dna repair mechanisms stratify ovarian cancer histotypes,"Aberrant DNA repair processes are a hallmark of human tumours. How these deficiencies variously impact the genomes of ovarian cancer between and within histotypes remains unknown. We studied the whole genome pointmutation and structural variation patterns of 133 tumours (59 high grade serous (HGSC), 35 clear cell (CCOC), 29 endometrioid (ENOC), and 10 adult granulosa cell tumours (GCT)) as a substrate for class discovery in ovarian cancer. Ab-initio clustering of integrated point mutation and structural variation signatures revealed seven novel subgroups, comprising between and within histotype stratification. Prevalence of fold-back inversions (FBI) co-localised with high level amplification events divided HGSC into two prognostically significant subgroups. This finding was recapitulated in two additional independent cohorts (total n=576 cases), and transcended gene based mutation status and gene expression as prognostically relevant features of HGSC. CCOC were divided into one group harbouring a signature reflective of active genome editing via APOBEC enzymes (26%) and a complementary group with an age-relatedmutational signature. ENOC were divided intomicrosatellite instable (MSI) cases (28%) with a distinctmismatch repairmutation signature and an outlying mutation rate, with the remainder of cases distributed amongst the remaining six groups. We suggest the FBI, MSI, and APOBEC groups represent biologic strata that could direct treatment strategies. Taken together, our work establishes the efficacy of the somatic genome as a biomarker to stratify ovarian cancers, simultaneously identifying patients that may benefit from emerging therapeutics and distinct subgroups within classic ovarian cancer histotypes."

They therefore provide unprecedented opportunities for investigating disease mechanisms and understanding the phenotypic consequences of genetic variation within the normal population.  HipSci brings  together diverse constitutents in genomics, proteomics, cell biology and clinical genetics to create a UK national iPS cell resource and use it to carry out cellular genetic studies.   Between 2013 and 2016 we aim to generate iPS cells from over 500  healthy individuals and 500 individuals with genetic disease. We will then use these cells to discover how genomic variation impacts on cellular phenotype and identify new disease mechanisms.  Strong links with NHS investigators will ensure that studies on the disease-associated cell lines will be linked to extensive clinical information.  Further key features of the project are an open access model of data sharing; engagement of the wider clinical genetics community in selecting patient samples; and provision of dedicated laboratory space for collaborative cell phenotyping and differentiation."

The data from these samples are initially published with Abbosh, C. et al. Phylogenetic ctDNA analysis depicts early stage lung cancer evolution. Nature http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22364 (2017).

Abstract: 
Earlier detection of relapse following primary surgery for non-small cell lung cancer and the characterization of emerging subclones seeding metastatic sites might offer new therapeutic approaches to limit tumor recurrence. The potential to non-invasively track tumor evolutionary dynamics in ctDNA of early-stage lung cancer is not established. Here we conduct a patient-specific approach to ctDNA profiling in the first 100 lung TRACERx (TRAcking Cancer Evolution through therapy (Rx)) study participants, including one patient co-recruited to the PEACE (Posthumous Evaluation of Advanced Cancer Environment) post-mortem study. We identify independent predictors of ctDNA release in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer and perform tumor volume limit of detection analyses. Through blinded profiling of post-operative plasma, we observe evidence of adjuvant chemotherapy resistance and identify patients destined to experience recurrence of their lung cancer. Finally, we show that phylogenetic ctDNA profiling tracks the subclonal nature of lung cancer relapse and metastases, providing a new approach for ctDNA driven therapeutic studies."

We found inter-tumor concordance for coding mutations; in contrast, gene copy numbers were found to be highly discordant between primary tumors and metastases as validated by fluorescent in-situ hybridization. in a further step, we dissected a single tumor into 68 spatially defined samples and sequenced them separately. Here we identify evenly distributed coding mutations in APC and TP53 in all tumor areas, yet highly variable gene copy numbers in numerous genes."
EGAS00001002450,mutations  spink2 induce azoospermia,"Azoospermia, characterized by the absence of spermatozoa in the ejaculate is a common cause of male infertility with a poorly characterized etiology. Exome sequencing analysis of two azoospermic brothers allowed the identification of a homozygous splice mutation in SPINK2, encoding a serine protease inhibitor believed to target acrosin, the main sperm acrosomal protease. In accord with these findings we observed that homozygous Spink2 KO male mice had azoospermia. Moreover, despite normal fertility, heterozygous male mice had a high rate of morphologically abnormal spermatozoa and a reduced sperm motility. Further analysis demonstrated that in the absence of Spink2, protease-induced stress initiates Golgi fragmentation and prevents acrosome biogenesis leading to spermatid differentiation arrest.  We also observed a deleterious effect of acrosin overexpression in HEK cells, effect that was alleviated by SPINK2 coexpression confirming its role as acrosin inhibitor. These results demonstrate that SPINK2 is necessary to neutralize proteases during their cellular transit towards the acrosome and that its deficiency induces a pathological continuum ranging from oligoasthenoteratozoospermia in heterozygotes to azoospermia in homozygotes."

EGAS00001001603, spatial organization  intratumor heterogeneity andevolutionary trajectories  metastases  hepatocellular carcinoma,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has one of the poorest survival amongst cancers. Using multi-regional sampling of nine resected HCC with different etiologies, we find that phylogenetic relationships of these sectors show diverse levels of genetic sharing spanning early to late diversification. Unlike the variegated pattern found in colorectal cancers, a large proportion of HCC display a clear Isolation-By-Distance pattern where spatially closer sectors are genetically more similar. Two resected intra-hepatic metastases showed genetic divergence occurring before and after primary tumor diversification respectively. Interestingly, metastatic tumors had much higher variability than their primary tumors, suggesting that intra-hepatic metastasis is accompanied by rapid diversification at the distant location. The presence of co-existing mutations offers the possibility of drug repositioning for HCC treatment. Taken together, these insights into intra-tumor heterogeneity allow for a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary trajectories of HCC and suggest novel avenues for personalized therapy."

Here we have undertaken large-scale genome wide association study (GWAS) for TGCT, encompassing ~7,500 cases and ~23,000 controls, through the Oncoarray consortium. We identified 19 novel loci, approximately doubling the number of known TGCT risk loci to 44 (P&lt;5x10-8)4-14 and conduct deep, high-throughput functional annotation of all risk loci. We establish a network of physical interactions for all risk SNPs to candidate casual genes in 3D space, using high-throughput chromosome conformation capture techniques (HiC) in TGCT cells. Firstly, functional evidence reveals widespread disruption of developmental transcriptional regulators, consistent with failed primordial germ cell differentiation as an initiating step in TGCT oncogenesis15. We secondly observe multiple risk loci associated with defective microtubule assembly, compatible with the high level of aneuploidy observed in TGCTs, suggesting gross chromosomal instability. Finally KIT-MAPK signalling features as a recurrently dysregulated pathway. In summary our findings substantially increase the number of known TGCT risk alleles, and provides a functional basis for disease susceptibility."

EGAS00001002338, genome sequence data  multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma,"Background &amp; Aims: The differentiation of distinct multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): multicentric disease vs. intrahepatic metastases, in which the management and prognosis varies substantively, remains problematic. We aim to stratify multifocal HCC and identify novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers by performing whole genome and transcriptome sequencing, as part of a multi-omics strategy Methods: A complete collection of tumour and somatic specimens (intrahepatic HCC lesions, matched non-cancerous liver tissue and blood) were obtained from representative patientswith multifocal HCC exhibiting two distinct postsurgical courses. Whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing with genotyping were performed for each tissue specimen to con-trast genomic alterations, including hepatitis B virus integrations, somatic mutations, copy number variations, and structural variations. We then constructed a phylogenetic tree to visualise individual tumour evolution and performed functional enrichment analyses on select differentially expressed genes to elucidate biological processes involved in multifocal HCC development. Multi-omics data were integrated with detailed clinicopathological information to identify HCC biomarkers, which were further validated using a large cohort of HCC patients (n = 174).Results: The multi-omics pro?ling and tumour biomarkers could successfully distinguish the two multifocal HCC types, while accurately predicting clonality and aggressiveness. The dual speci?city protein kinase TTK, which is a key mitotic checkpoint regulator with links to p53 signaling, was further shown to be a promising overall prognostic marker for HCC in the large patient cohort.Conclusions: Comprehensive multi-omics characterisation of multifocal tumour evolution may improve clinical decision-making, facilitate personalised medicine, and expedite identi?cation of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in HCC."

Whole exome sequencing (WES) performed on two azoospermic brothers, identified a mutation in the MAGEB4 gene which was confirmed via Sanger sequencing and then screened for on control groups and unrelated infertile subjects. The effect of the mutation on mRNA and protein levels were tested after in vitro cell transfection. Structural features of MAGEB4 were predicted throughout the conserved MAGE domain.Results: The novel single base substitution (c.1041A&gt;T) in the X-linked MAGEB4 gene was identified as a no-stop mutation. The mutation is predicted to add 24 amino acids to the C-terminus of MAGEB4. Our functional studies were unable to detect any effect either on mRNA stability, intracellular localization of the protein or the ability to homo / heterodimerize with other MAGE proteins. We thus hypothesize that these additional amino acids may affect the proper protein interactions with MAGEB4 partners. Conclusion: The whole exome analysis of a consanguineous Turkish family revealed MAGEB4 as a possible new X-linked cause of inherited male infertility. This study provides the first clue to the physiological function of a MAGE protein."
EGAS00001002380,botswana 15 autosomal unlinked microsatellites,"Population structure was investigated in 990 Botswana individuals according to ethno-linguistics, Bantu and Khoisan, and geography (the nine administrative districts) using the AmpFLSTR Identifiler autosomal microsatellite markers. Genetic diversity and forensic parameters were calculated for the overall population, and according to ethno-linguistics and geography. The overall combined power of exclusion (CPE) was 0.9999965412 and the combined match probability 6,28 x 10-19. CPE was highest for the Khoisan Tuu ethnolinguistic group and the Northeast District at 0.9999582029 and 0.9999922652 respectively. CMP ranged from 6.28 x 10-19 (Khoisan Tuu) to 1,02 x 10-18 (Northwest district). Using pairwise genetic distances (FST), analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), factorial correspondence analysis (FCA), and the unsupervised Bayesian clustering method found in  STRUCTURE and landscape genetics software TESS, ethno-linguistics were found to have a greater influence on population structure than geography. FCA showed clustering between Bantu and Khoisan, and within the Bantu. This Bantu sub-structuring was not seen with STRUCTURE and TESS, which detected clustering only between Bantu and Khoisan. The patterns of population structure revealed highlight the need for regional reference databases that include ethno-linguistic and geographic location information. These markers have important potential for bio-anthropological studies as well as for forensic applications."

These diseases are genetically diverse and associated with rare mutations ina large number of genes, many of which overlap among the phenotypes. To betterinvestigate the genetic overlap between these three phenotypes and to identify newgenotype-phenotype correlations, we designed a custom gene panel consisting of 115genes known to be associated with cardiomyopathic phenotypes and channelopathies.A cohort of 38 unrelated patients, 16 affected by DCM, 14 by HCM and 8 by ARVC,was recruited for the study on the basis of more severe phenotypes and family historyof cardiomyopathy and/or sudden death."
EGAS00001000903,genome diversity  africa project,"Globally, human populations show structured genetic diversity as a result of geographical dispersion, selection and drift. Understanding this genetic variation can provide insights into the evolutionary processes that shape both human adaptation and variation in disease. Populations from Africa have the highest levels of genetic diversity. This characteristic, in addition to historical genetic admixture, can lead to complexities in the design of studies assessing the genetic determinants of disease and human variation. However, such studies of African populations are also likely to provide new opportunities to discover novel disease susceptibility loci and variants and refine gene–disease association signals. A systematic assessment of genetic diversity within Africa would facilitate genomic epidemiological studies in the region.The Genome Diversity in Africa Project (GDAP) will extend and expand the African Genome Variation (AGV) project, an international collaboration aimed to produce a comprehensive catalogue of human genetic variation in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Using a sequencing-based approach, GDA project aims to capture human genetic variation in Africa, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), structural variants, and haplotypes. This resource will make a substantial contribution to understanding patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations in Africa, as well as providing a global resource to help design, implement and interpret genomic studies in African populations and studies comprising globally diverse populations, complementing existing genomic resources. Specifically, we plan to carry out whole genome sequencing of up to 2000 individuals across Africa (100 individuals from each ethnolinguistic group), and complement these data with 2.5M Illumina genotyping. We have already completed sequencing at low coverage (4x) of 700 individuals across SSA, we are now adding an additional 500 samples from up to 5 ethno-linguistic groups within Africa, including populations from Morocco, Ghana and Kenya.Our scientific objectives are to: 1) develop a resource that provides a comprehensive catalogue of genetic variation in populations from Africa accessible to the global scientific community; 2) characterise population genetic diversity, structure, gene flow and admixture across Africa; 3) develop a cost-efficient, next-generation genotype array for diverse populations across Africa; and 4) facilitate whole genome-sequencing association studies of complex traits and diseases by developing a reference panel for imputation and resource for enhancing fine-mapping disease susceptibility loci. These scientific objectives will be supported by cross-cutting operational activities, including network and management of the consortium, research ethics, and research capacity building in statistical genetics and bioinformatics."
EGAS00001002423,cisplatin increases sensitivity  fgfr inhibition  patient derived xenograft models  lung squamous cell carcinoma,"Lung squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) is a molecularly complex and genomically unstable disease. No targeted therapy is currently approved for lung SqCC, although potential oncogenic drivers of SqCC have been identified, including amplification of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1). Reports from a recently completed clinical trial indicate low response rates in patients treated with FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, suggesting inadequacy of FGFR1 amplification as a biomarker of response, or the need for combination treatment. We aimed to develop accurate models of lung SqCC and determine improved targeted therapies for these tumors. We show that detection of FGFR1 mRNA by RNA in situ hybridisation is a better predictor of response to FGFR inhibition than FGFR1 gene amplification using clinically relevant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of lung SqCC. FGFR1-overexpressing tumors were observed in all histological subtypes of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) as assessed on a tissue microarray, indicating a broader range of tumors that may respond to FGFR inhibitors. In FGFR1-overexpressing PDX tumors, we observed increased differentiation and reduced proliferation following FGFR inhibition. Combination therapy with cisplatin was able to increase tumor cell death, and dramatically prolonged animal survival compared to single agent treatment. Our data suggest that FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors can benefit NSCLC patients with FGFR1-overexpressing tumors and provides a rationale for clinical trials combining cisplatin with FGFR inhibitors."

PTCL-NOSs account for about 25% of all PTCLs and are currently diagnosed based on exclusion criteria, as this lymphomas lack unifying morphological, phenotypic and genomic features. Cytogenetic and FISH analysis of PTCL-NOS samples have not revealed recurrent pathogenetic abnormalities, while gene expression profiling has shown only partial ability to segregate cases representing homogeneous clinic-pathological entities. This underscores the need to look at PTCL-NOS with innovative and high-throughput approaches to identify recurrent genetic lesions that could further our understanding of the biology of this heterogeneous group of diseases, provide better diagnostic tools and perhaps new targets for innovative treatments.
Our aim is to study ~15 patients affected by PTCL-NOS. Out study will be funded by a private, non-profit Italian cancer research fund (Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro, www.airc.it) based on a grant owned by Anna Dodero and Cristiana Carniti, hematologists at INT.

For many years both in the anthropological and forensic field hair colour prediction from DNA has been a subjects of a number of publications. Here we present a prediction tool in a form of a mathematical model incorporating genotype of selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to determine hair colour. 22 SNPs within genes involved in human pigmentation were genotyped in a group of 186 Polish subjects representing different shades of hair colour. Based on the results genotype-phenotype association analysis was performed and multinomial logistic regression model for hair colour prediction from a set of SNPs was created. We identified seven variants highly associated with different hair colour categories. The obtained model utilized 11 genetic variants to categorize hair colour of an individual into one of the three established categories: red, blond and dark. Validation of our model showed good prediction accuracies expressed as area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic, this is AUC of 0.87 for the red haired, 0.84 for the dark haired and 0.77 for blond haired; this results are comparable with the parameters of other prediction models published in the recent years. Our model utilizes small number of genetic variants, allows for a reasonably accurate identification of hair colour and incorporates additional informative polymorphisms used for the first time as markers in a hair colour prediction model."

In adulthood 45,X monosomy is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, although strikingly heterogeneous with some individuals left untouched while others suffer from cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease and infertility. The present study investigates the leukocyte DNAmethylation profile by using the 450K-Illumina Infinium assay and the leukocyte RNA-expression profile in 45,X monosomy compared with karyotypically normal female and male controls. We present results illustrating that genome wide X-chromosome RNA-expression profile, autosomal DNA-methylation profile, and the X-chromosome methylation profile clearly distinguish Turner syndrome from controls. Our results reveal genome wide hypomethylation with most differentially methylated positions showing a medium level of methylation. Contrary to previous studies, applying a single loci specific analysis at well-defined DNA loci, our results indicate that the hypomethylation extend to repetitive elements.

EGAS00001003289,synthetic rna modulators  gene function  pilot study,"While the scale of GWAS, and number of discovered loci associated with traits has substantially increased over the past decade, functional validation, and understanding of underlying biology driving these associations has lagged behind; limiting translation of these discoveries into therapeutic applications. In this context, synthetic RNA modulators of gene function provide an efficient, and high-throughput mechanism for validation of discoveries in cellular models, providing a platform for interrogation and translation of findings from GWAS, into therapeutic applications within an integrated platform. An improvement in our understanding of the regulation of gene functions by different types of RNA modulators, and the technological development in the field of synthetic RNA molecules, has enabled high-throughput functional assays of cellular phenotypes in multiple cellular models, as well as opportunities to translate these discoveries directly into therapeutics. Complementary to this, recent development of deep learning approaches to effectively predict miRNA-target associations (Rayner et al., 2017) and promoter regions have provided a rich database of computationally predicted modulators of gene function for functional validation. We propose a high-throughput screen of 380 synthetic RNA molecules across 15 genes identified as associated with cardiometabolic and other traits through multiple lines of evidence (GWAS, eQTL, functional studies, and/or mouse phenotyping). We will use a range of synthetic RNA molecules to target a set of genes of interest in cellular models (HepG2 cell lines), to examine changes in target gene expression (efficacy), immunogenicity and cell-viability. Promoters will be identified through existing databases, and deep learning and bioinformatics approaches; we will also use predicted miRNA-target associations identified through deep learning frameworks trained on experimental evidence (Rayner et al., 2017), as part of an established collaboration. Alongside integrated genetic and EHR data, such datasets provide the opportunity to align multidimensional data to understand loci associated with disease, and identify potential therapeutic targets.

EGAS00001001655,rna seq analysis  transcriptome variation  human esc subclones,"Many studies over the past 10 years, culminating in the recent report of the International Stem Cell Initiative (ISCI, 2011) have shown that hPSC acquire genetic and epigenetic changes during their time in culture. Many of the genetic changes are non-random and recurrent, probably because they provide a selective growth advantage to the undifferentiated cells. Some are shared by embryonal carcinoma cells, the malignant counterparts of ES cells. The origins of these growth advantages are poorly understood, but may come from altered cell cycle dynamics, resistance to apoptosis or altered patterns of differentiation. Less is known about the nature and consequences of epigenetic changes, but it is likely that these similarly affect hPSC behaviour; e.g., enhanced expression of DLK1, an imprinted gene, is associated with altered hPSC growth (Enver et al 2005). Inevitably, these genetic and epigenetic changes will impact on our ability to use hPSC for regenerative medicine, either because malignant transformation of the undifferentiated cells or their differentiated derivatives to be used for transplantation compromises safety, or because they impede the function of those differentiated derivatives, or because they affect the efficiency with which the undifferentiated cells can be expanded and differentiated into desired cell types. Focusing initially upon the existing clinical grade hESC lines, later moving to iPSC, we will Consolidate and extend knowledge of the rate, type and functional impact of the genetic variations that occur during hPSC culture. We will use whole genome and exome sequencing as well as SNP arrays, together with clonal analysis and other cytogenetics techniques. Common changes will be compared with those found in the normal human population, at low frequency in the original cell population or observed during iPSC generation in the HIPSCI project currently based at the WTSI. These studies will provide a better understanding of the range of genetic changes that occur in hPSC beyond the CNVs already identified.

To investigate genomic aberration profiles, we applied whole genome and whole exome sequencing, and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization on 15 intrapulmonary tumors derived from six patients with synchronous multifocal lung cancers having similar histological diagnosis. Any pair of intrapulmonary tumors in a single patient, which shared the identical genetic background and environment, showed an extinctive heterogeneity between each other. Phylogenetic relationship analysis indicated an independently branched evolution among all the tumors, suggesting they were multiple primary lung cancers. EGFR or KRAS mutations were found in 7 or 3 out of the 15 tumors, from 3 or 2 patients, respectively. Somatic mutational heterogeneity of these two genes in a single patient was also observed.  Our analysis indicates genomic aberration profiling is valuable for identification of multiple primary lung cancer, especially when high histopathological concordance was observed between lesions.  We also suggest a thoroughly molecular diagnosis against therapeutic target genes should be taken for each accessible nodule before making a plan for adjuvant therapy."
EGAS00001002164, genetic landscape  bcl2 break negative follicular lymphoma,"Background: 15% of high and 50% of low stage FL lack the t(14;18). Nevertheless, most of these cases express BCL2 by so far unknown mechanisms. Principals/Methodology: To find molecular mechanisms, triggering FL-pathogenesis in t(14;18)-negative FL, the exonic SNV-profiles of 33 FL with and 16 FL without t(14;18) were assessed by whole exome-sequencing and external SNV-data integration. The SNV-profile of the whole exome-sequenced FL was correlated with copy number, LOH and gene-expression data. Finally, the N-glycosylation status was assessed (LympTrack assay) in a separate validation cohort. Results: SNVs in FL with and without t(14;18) affected different genes, but accumulated in similar pathways, e.g. apoptosis, epigenetic processes and cell cycle/proliferation. Mutations in genes associated with immune-response were more prominently and those associated with NFkB and N-glycosylation selectively enriched in t(14;18)-negative FL. ~50% of mutated genes showed BCL2-asociation at high confidence in FL with and without t(14;18). Moreover, among the genes mutated in t(14;18)-negative FL 555 (~1/3) were affected by copy number alterations and/or copy-neutral LOH, 125 were differently expressed between FL with and without t(14;18) (p&lt;0.01) and 62 were differentially expressed and affected by copy number alterations and/or copy-neutral LOH. N-glycosylation was strongly reduced in t(14;18)-negative FL as compared to results reported for historical FL cohorts. Conclusion: These results suggest a stronger crosstalk with the microenvironment that may compensate for the lack of N-glycosylation and a diverse portfolio of SNVs that may contribute to the upregulation of BCL2 and FL pathogenesis in t(14;18)-negative FL."

Using chromatin data collected in T2E and non-T2E primary prostate tumors, we show a distinct cis-regulatory landscape between T2E and non-T2E, inclusive of Cluster Of Regulatory Elements (COREs). This is mediated by ERG co-option of HOXB13 and FOXA1 implementing a T2E-specific transcriptional profile. We also report a T2E-specific CORE on the structurally rearranged ERG locus arising from spreading of the TMPRSS2 locus pre-existing CORE, assisting in its overexpression. Finally, we show that the T2E-specific cis-regulatory landscape reveals a vulnerability against the NOTCH pathway.

Cells from the patient, carrying the compound heterozygous mutations c.205_206dupCC and c.1916T&gt;A in RFWD3, show increased sensitivity to DNA interstrand cross-linking agents in terms of increased chromosomal breakage, reduced survival and cell cycle arrest in G2 phase. The cellular phenotype is mirrored in genetically engineered human and avian cells by inactivation of RFWD3 or by introduction of the patient-derived missense mutation, and is rescued by expression of wildtype RFWD3 protein. HR is disrupted in RFWD3 mutant cells, caused by impaired relocation of mutant RFWD3 to chromatin and defective physical interaction with RPA. Rfwd3 knockout mice exhibit increased embryonic lethality, are sub-fertile, show ovarian and testicular atrophy and have a reduced life span in which they resemble other FA mouse models. Although mutation was detected in a single child with FA yet, we propose RFWD3 as a novel FA gene, FANCW, supported by cellular paradigm systems and an animal model."

EGAS00001000928,understanding  genetic determinants  disease   lens   splicing code,"A fundamental challenge in genomics research is to accurately predict the consequences of genetic variation on gene regulation. We present a new approach that uses a regulatory model of splicing to determine how a variant impacts exon inclusion. This contrasts sharply with, but can be used to amplify the sensitivity of, techniques that compare variants using multiple genomes or genome annotations. By computing ‘misregulation scores’ for 658,420 single nucleotide variations, we observe that our system reliably detects disease-causing variants, even when they are synonymous or located within introns. The analysis reveals genome-wide trends in how mutations cause disease; for example, missense exonic mutations that least impact protein function are five times more likely to disrupt splicing regulation than highly deleterious mutations. Our approach provides new insights into altered regulatory mechanisms in spinal muscular atrophy, nonpolyposis colorectal cancer and autism, and elucidates new candidate disease genes. The regulatory model thus opens the door to previously impossible explorations into how genetic variation impacts human disease."

EGAS00001002611,identification  functional characterization  secondary itreg clones  tumor patients,"Regulatory T-cells (Treg) are a major obstacle of efficient cancer immune-surveillance, as they prevent tumor eradication by tumor-antigen (TA)-specific conventional T cells (Tconv), supporting cancer development.  Indeed, Treg numbers are increased in tumors and peripheral blood of cancer patients correlating with poor prognosis. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of Treg repertoire formation in cancer patients is of major importance for the design of efficient cancer immunotherapies. In tumor-bearing mice, Treg accumulation results predominantly from the proliferation of pre-existing natural Treg (nTreg) but also from the conversion of tumor-killing Tconv into tumor-promoting induced Treg (iTreg) under suppressive conditions within the tumor-microenvironment. Nevertheless, Treg origin in tumor patients remains largely unknown. This study investigates the existence of TA-specific iTreg in tumor patients and their relevant contribution to the TCR repertoire of the Treg pool in the periphery.  A few highly-expanded clonotypes were detected among both Treg and Tconv from cancer patients in contrast to the highly polyclonal populations in healthy individuals. However, no major overlap was observed between Treg and Tconv in the blood of tumor patients and healthy individuals, arguing against the existence of tumor-specific iTreg in the circulation. Interestingly, within tumors of the same patients we detected highly expanded clones not only among Treg but also within an intermediate Activated (Act Tconv) population. Both Tconv and Act Tconv subsets shared dominant highly expanded clonotypes with Treg, shaping of the tumor-infiltrating Treg repertoire but with no effect in Treg from peripheral blood. Taken together, our data support the hypothesis that within the tumor dominant tumor-killing TA-specific Tconv may convert to tumor-promoting iTreg with a major impact on the tumor-infiltrating Treg population. To prove this hypothesis, we need to identify whether two different cells, one of a Treg suppressive profile and one of a non-suppressive tumor-killing Tconv phenotype, share the same TCR and, thus, have a common clonal origin due to peripheral iTreg generation. To this direction, we have already isolated tumor-infiltrating Treg and Tconv from freshly resected tumors and blood of breast cancer patients using single-cell FACS sorting and plan to apply the G&amp;T method that combines total mRNA sequencing  and methylation analysis on the same single-cell, as already established by the group of Prof. Thierry Voet (Macaulay et al 2015).

Mouse and human tumour genome analyses have identified the mutational signatures of several known carcinogens, but many human cancers, including lung, carry specific signatures of exposure to agents that are as yet unknown. Here, we will address the question of how exposure to a wide variety of exogenous agents can shape genomic architecture. Specifically, we will characterize the mutational signatures of dozens of suspected/known human carcinogens used to induce hundreds of mouse tumours and then look for these signatures in human tumours. Other aspects of tumour biology will also be explored, such as the profile of the epigenome following carcinogen exposure, driver genes, and the effect that carcinogens have on the copy number landscape and profile of structural variants found in tumours."

Induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from pancreatic beta-cells (BiPSCs) preferentially differentiate towards endocrine pancreas-like cells versus those from fibroblasts (FiPSCs). We interrogated genome-wide open chromatin in BiPSCs and FiPSCs via ATAC-seq, and identified ~8.3k significant, differential open chromatin sites (DOCS) between the two iPSC subtypes (FDR&lt;0.05). DOCS where chromatin was more accessible in BiPSCs (Bi-DOCS) were significantly enriched for known regulators of endodermal development, including bivalent and weak enhancers, and FOXA2 binding sites (FDR&lt;0.05). Bi-DOCS were associated with genes related to pancreas development and beta-cell function, including transcription factors mutated in monogenic diabetes (PDX1, NKX2-2, HNF1A; FDR&lt;0.05). Moreover, Bi-DOCS correlated with enhanced gene expression in BiPSC-derived definitive endoderm and pancreatic progenitor cells.

EGAS00001002654, system wide approach  monitor responses  synergistic braf  egfr inhibition  colorectal cancer cells,"Molecular heterogeneity of tumors, epigenetic changes and a diverse range of molecular mechanisms are main contributors to drug resistance, which represents one of the great challenges in cancer treatment. A deeper understanding of the molecular biology of cancer has resulted in better targeted therapies, where one or multiple drugs are adopted in novel therapies to tackle resistance. This beneficial effect of using combination treatments has to some extent also been observed in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation, whereby dual inhibition of BRAF(V600E) and EGFR increases antitumor activity. Notwithstanding this success, it is not clear whether this combination treatment is the only or most effective treatment to block resistance. Here, we investigate molecular responses upon single and multi-target treatments, over time, using BRAF(V600E) mutant CRC cells as a well-define model system. Through integration of transcriptomic, proteomic and phosphoproteomics data we obtain a comprehensive overview, revealing both well-known and novel responses. We primarily observe widespread upregulation of tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and and metabolic pathways. This points to by which the treated cells switch energy sources as a defensive response entering a quiescent like state, while activating signalling to re-activate the MAPK pathway."

Assessment of their turnover in duodenal transplants revealed that all Mf subsets were completely replaced over time; Mf1 and Mf2, phenotypically similar to peripheral blood monocytes (PBMo), were largely replaced within 3 weeks, whereas two subsets with features of mature Mf, Mf3 and Mf4, exhibited significantly slower replacement. Mf3 and Mf4 localized differently in SI; Mf3 formed a dense network in mucosal lamina propria, whereas Mf4 was enriched in submucosa. Transcriptomic analysis showed that all Mf subpopulations subsets were markedly distinct from PBMo and dendritic cells (DC). Compared to PBMo, Mf subpopulations showed reduced responsiveness to proinflammatory stimuli, but were proficient at endocytosis of particulate and soluble material. These data provide a comprehensive analysis of human SI Mf population and suggest a precursor-progeny relationship with PBMo."

The patient was treated with the PI3Kα inhibitor BYL719 and achieved a lasting clinical response on BYL719, but eventually progressed to treatment and died shortly thereafter. A rapid autopsy was performed and a total of 14 metastatic lesions were collected for further analysis. In order to identify possible genetic determinants of acquired resistance to PI3Kα inhibition, we took a three-step approach. First, we examined both the primary tumor (before BYL719 treatment) and the new lung metastasis by whole genome sequencing (DNA from the spleen was used as a normal control). Then, we analyzed the primary tumor, lung metastasis, and the peri-aortic lesion that remained stable (responding) at the time of progression to BYL719 therapy by whole exome sequencing. Finally, to confirm and expand our findings, we sequenced the primary tumor and all the metastatic lesions to &gt;500-fold coverage using a custom targeted deep-sequencing assay, MSK-IMPACT. Using this 3-step approach, we have demonstrated that patient’s lesion underwent parallel genetic evolution at multiple metastatic sites with different PTEN genomic alterations leading to a convergent PTEN- null phenotype resistant to PI3Kα inhibition. In order to expand our observations, we analyzed paired samples (pre-treatment and at progression) from six additional patients enrolled in the BYL719 trial. Acquired bi-allelic loss of PTEN was found in one additional patient treated with BYL719 whereas in two patients PIK3CA mutations present in the primary tumor were no longer detected at the time of progression. To functionally characterize our findings, inducible PTEN knockdown in sensitive cells resulted in resistance to BYL719, while simultaneous PI3K-p110β blockade reverted this resistance phenotype, both in cell lines and in PTEN-null xenografts derived from our patient. We conclude that parallel genetic evolution of separate sites with different PTEN genomic alterations leads to a convergent PTEN-null phenotype resistant to PI3Kα inhibition."

Understanding this genetic variation can provide insights into the evolutionary processes that shape both human adaptation and variation in disease. Populations from SSA have the highest levels of genetic diversity. This characteristic, in addition to historical genetic admixture, can lead to complexities in the design of studies assessing the genetic determinants of disease and human variation. However, such studies of African populations are also likely to provide new opportunities to discover novel disease susceptibility loci and variants and refine gene–disease association signals. A systematic assessment of genetic diversity within SSA would facilitate genomic epidemiological studies in the region. The Genome Diversity in Africa Project (GDAP) aims to produce a comprehensive catalogue of human genetic variation in SSA, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), structural variants, and haplotypes. This resource will make a substantial contribution to understanding patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations in SSA, as well as providing a global resource to help design, implement and interpret genomic studies in SSA populations and studies comprising globally diverse populations, complementing existing genomic resources. Specifically, we plan to carry out high depth whole genome sequencing of up to 2000 individuals across Africa (25 individuals from each ethnolinguistic group). Our scientific objectives are to: 1) develop a resource that provides a comprehensive catalogue of genetic variation in populations from SSA accessible to the global scientific community; 2) characterise population genetic diversity, structure, gene flow and admixture across SSA; 3) develop a cost-efficient, next-generation genotype array for diverse populations across SSA; and 4) facilitate whole genome-sequencing association studies of complex traits and diseases by developing a reference panel for imputation and resource for enhancing fine-mapping disease susceptibility loci. These scientific objectives will be supported by cross-cutting operational activities, including network and management of the consortium, research ethics, and research capacity building in statistical genetics and bioinformatics.

Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) is a familial syndrome resulting from germline mutation of the two-hit tumor suppressor gene, Fumarate Hydratase (FH). HLRCC renal tumors present often in young adults, exhibit unique histological features and are particularly aggressive. HLRCC is uncommon and poorly understood, and whether there are sporadic renal tumors with similar characteristics, is unclear. Notably, FH can also be inactivated somatically in RCC, and should be included among FH-deficient (FHD) kidney tumors. We identified a tumor clade without FH mutations but with similar morphological and molecular characteristics as well as aggressive clinical behavior, which we name FHDL (FHD-like). We show that FHD/FHDL tumors represent a unique subtype of CIMP (CpG Island Methylator Phenotype) with the highest levels of overall genome methylation and CDKN2A silencing. FHD/FHDL tumors are characterized by convergent activation of the Hippo pathway as determined by frequent and mutually exclusive mutations in NF2 and PTPN14. AKR1B10, an NRF2 target, was upregulated in FHD/FHDL tumors as well as GATA3, which suggests a shared origin in the renal medulla and is consistent with topological studies.

At the time we sequenced the exome of 6 affected individuals but did not identify any coding variants which appear to explain the high prevalence of disease.  Since then we have collected DNA from a large number of additional family members, genotyped linkage arrays on the entire family to refine genomic regions shared by identity by descent and genotyped affected and unaffected members at known CD risk loci identified by Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS).  These analyses have confirmed that a significant unexplained excess of disease remains after accounting for all known genetic factors, and that several regions of the genome are shared by a large fraction of affected individuals.  We therefore perform whole genomes sequencing from 8 individuals which will allow us to impute the complete sequence of nearly all the members of the two largest and most severely affected branches of the family."

Increased sodium permeability and stretch-sensitivity of mutant TREK-1 channels may trigger arrhythmias in areas of the heart with high physical strain such as the RVOT.

New methods that enable simple yet high-throughput single-cell expression profiling are highly desirable. Here we report a novel nanowell-based single-cell RNA sequencing system, ICELL8, which enables processing of thousands of cells per sample. The system employs a 5184-nanowell-containing microchip to capture ~1300 single cells and process them. Each nanowell contains preprinted oligonucleotides encoding poly-d(T), a unique well barcode, and a unique molecular identifier. The ICELL8 system uses imaging software to identify nanowells containing viable single cells and only wells with single cells are processed into sequencing libraries. Here, we report the performance and utility of ICELL8 using samples of increasing complexity from cultured cells to mouse solid tissue samples. Our assessment of the system to discriminate between mixed human and mouse cells showed that ICELL8 has a low cell multiplet rate (&lt; 3%) and low cross-cell contamination. We characterized single-cell transcriptomes of more than a thousand cultured human and mouse cells as well as 468 mouse pancreatic islets cells. We were able to identify distinct cell types in pancreatic islets, including alpha, beta, delta and gamma cells. Overall, ICELL8 provides efficient and cost-effective single-cell expression profiling of thousands of cells, allowing researchers to decipher single-cell transcriptomes within complex biological samples."

Confirmation of HGG diagnosis by  reference pathology was mandatory before randomisation, followed by review with five independent expert neuropathologists. We collected specimens from 89 patients consenting to translational research, and performed Sanger sequencing for H3F3A, Illumina 450K BeadArray methylation profiling, and whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing where possible. 7/89 patients (8%) harboured H3F3A G34R/V mutations, whilst 24/89 (27%) harboured H3F3A K27M, the latter reflecting a high proportion of the novel entity recognised in the 2016 WHO classification of diffuse midline glioma with H3K27M mutation. Both histone mutations conferred a significantly shorter progression-free (p=0.0104) and overall survival (p=0.00159). 450K methylation subtyping additionally identified a number of subgroups in histone wild-type cases. These included infrequent (4/86, 4.6%) cases with IDH1 mutation in older children, further categorised into astrocytic ATRX-mutant (n=3) or 1p19q co-deleted with TERT promoter mutation (n=1). 9/74, (12%) of cases were classified as biologically resembling pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) by methylation profiling, with 5/9 harbouring BRAF V600E mutations and epithelioid histology, and 3/9 NF1 mutation and giant cell features. Three cases had methylation profiles more closely resembling low grade gliomas, though were morphologically high grade, and harboured MAPK dysregulation in two cases, with the third part of an additional infant (&lt;3yrs) cohort. Finally, four cases had a mutational burden several orders of magnitude higher than the rest, with (2197-5332) somatic coding variants/sample reflecting a hypermutator phenotype. These data provide an important insight into the wide biological diversity of ‘HGG’ found in the paediatric age group and allow for a profound refinement of clinical trial interpretation."

Loss of these modifications, whether due to mutations in genes belonging to histone tail-modifying complexes or directly affecting the histone tail, cause developmental disorders2-5 or play a role in tumorigenesis6. Despite this knowledge, however, very little is known about the function of modifications affecting the histone core. Here we report monoallelic missense mutations affecting Lysine 91 in the histone H4 core (H4K91) in three individuals with a syndrome of growth delay, microcephaly and intellectual disability. Expression of the H4 mutants in zebrafish embryos recapitulate the developmental anomalies seen in the patients. We show that the H4 mutations cause genomic instability, resulting in increased apoptosis and cell cycle progression anomalies during early development. Mechanistically, our findings indicate an important role for the ubiquitination of H4K91 in genomic stability during embryonic development."

CIN is driven by an increase in the frequency of chromosome segregation errors and a tolerance phenotype that permits the propagation of aneuploid genomes. Through exome sequencing analysis of aneuploid and diploid colorectal cancers (CRC), we find frequent loss of heterozygosity and truncating mutations in BCL9L enriched in aneuploid tumours. Functional characterization revealed that BCL9L loss of function promoted tolerance of chromosome missgregation events, development of aneuploidy and increased tumourigenesis in xenograft models. We find that BCL9L dysfunction contributes to aneuploidy-tolerance in both TP53 wild type and mutant cells by reducing basal caspase-2 levels, preventing cleavage of BID and MDM2. Efforts to exploit aneuploidy tolerance mechanisms and the BCL9L/Caspase-2/BID axis may limit cancer diversity and evolution."

In a previous analysis, we estimated that ~47% of highly autozygous Pakistani probands were likely to be explained by recessive coding variants, and ~18% by de novo coding mutations. These estimates assume that each patient’s phenotype is fully attributable to a single pathogenic variant (or pair of compound heterozygous variants). This is probably an over-simplification, particularly in the case of highly autozygous patients who have multiple rare homozygous variants, several of which may contribute to their phenotypes. DDD probands who are offspring of first cousins are only ~half as likely to have a diagnostic de novo coding mutation (the most common type of diagnostic variant in DDD), after controlling for the presence of at least one damaging biallelic coding variant. This suggests that autozygosity may be contributing to rare developmental disorders beyond a simple monogenic coding mechanism.

It is likely that genomic variation in the host, infecting microbe, and commensal microbiota are key determinants of infectious disease clinical outcomes. However, until recently, simultaneous, multiomic investigation of infecting microbe and holobiont components has rarely been explored. Herein, we characterized the infecting microbe, host, micro- and mycobiomes leading up to infection onset in a leukemia patient that developed invasive mucormycosis. We discovered that the patient was infected with a strain of the recently described Mucor velutinosus species which we determined was hypervirulent in a Drosophila challenge model and has a predisposition for skin dissemination. After completing the infecting M. velutinosus genome and genomes from four other Mucor species, comparative pathogenomics was performed and assisted in identifying 66 M. velutinosus-specific putatively secreted proteins, including multiple novel secreted aspartyl proteinases which may contribute to the unique clinical presentation of skin dissemination. Whole exome sequencing of the patient revealed multiple non-synonymous polymorphisms in genes critical to control of fungal proliferation, such as TLR6 and PTX3. Moreover, the patient had a non-synonymous polymorphism in the NOD2 gene and a missense mutation in FUT2, which have been linked to microbial dysbiosis and microbiome diversity maintenance during physiologic stress, respectively. In concert with host genetic polymorphism data, the micro- and mycobiome analyses revealed that the infection developed amid a dysbiotic microbiome with low α-diversity, dominated by staphylococci. Additionally, longitudinal mycobiome data showed that M. velutinosus DNA was detectable in oral samples preceding disease onset. Our genome-level study of the host-infecting microbe-commensal triad extends the concept of personalized genomic medicine to the holobiont-infecting microbe interface thereby offering novel opportunities for using synergistic genetic methods to increase understanding of infectious diseases pathogenesis and clinical outcomes."

We demonstrate that one-quarter of non-coding mutations in regions of kataegis outside the Ig loci are located in genes relevant to CLL. We show that non-coding mutations in ATM may negatively impact on ATM expression and find non-coding and regulatory region mutations in TCL1A, and in IgHVunmut CLL in IKZF3, SAMHD1,PAX5 and BIRC3. Finally, we show that IgHVunmut CLL is dominated by coding mutations in driver genes and an aging signature, whereas IgHVmut CLL has a high incidence of promoter and enhancer mutations caused by aberrant activation-induced cytidine deaminase activity. Taken together, our data support the hypothesis that differences in clinical outcome and biological characteristics between the two subgroups might reflect differences in mutation distribution, incidence and distinct underlying mutagenic mechanisms."

Using 1000 genomes cell lines, we will generate high coverage RNAseq data (Illumina HiSeq) from 6 different populations across Africa; the first large-scale resource to examine eQTLs within Africa. Specifically we intend to sequence transcriptomes from 600 unrelated individuals from six populations from West (Gambian, The Gambia; Mende, Sierra Leone; Esan and Yoruba, Nigeria) and East Africa (Luhya and Masai, Kenya). This resource will help understand the transcriptional landscape in African populations, population differences in the diversity of splicing isoforms, as well as identify novel transcripts and exons across the genome. Such a tool will be invaluable for the interpretation of findings from large-scale GWAS being conducted in Africa, supporting initiatives such as the H3A consortium.

These include embryonic development, transcription,chromatin structure, X chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting and chromosomestability. Consistent with these important roles, a growing number of human diseases havebeen found to be associated with aberrant DNA methylation. The study of these diseases hasprovided new and fundamental insights into the roles that DNA methylation and otherepigenetic modifications have in development and normal cellular homeostasis.However, there is a paucity of data in regards to methylation in complex disorders especiallyin the field of cardiovascular disease, but given the availability of human IPs cells derivationfrom patients one can now go through the differentiation process from inital derivation offibroblasts, to ips cells to terminally differenitated cardiomycytes.To investigate the epigenetic changes in health and disease in a developmental context wehope to use normal and mutant patient fibroblasts for the generation of human Ips cells.

EGAS00001001111,gdap wgs,"Globally, human populations show structured genetic diversity as a result of geographical dispersion, selection and drift. Understanding this genetic variation can provide insights into the evolutionary processes that shape both human adaptation and variation in disease. Populations from SSA have the highest levels of genetic diversity. This characteristic, in addition to historical genetic admixture, can lead to complexities in the design of studies assessing the genetic determinants of disease and human variation. However, such studies of African populations are also likely to provide new opportunities to discover novel disease susceptibility loci and variants and refine gene–disease association signals. A systematic assessment of genetic diversity within SSA would facilitate genomic epidemiological studies in the region.The African Genome Variation Project (AGVP) is an international collaboration that aims to produce a comprehensive catalogue of human genetic variation in SSA. This resource has extended our understanding of population history, patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations in SSA, as well as providing a global resource to help design, implement and interpret genomic studies.The Genome Diversity in Africa Project (GDAP) will extend and expand the African Genome Variation (AGV) project. Using a sequencing-based approach, GDA project aims to produce a comprehensive catalogue of human genetic variation in SSA, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), structural variants, and haplotypes. This resource will make a substantial contribution to understanding patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations in SSA, as well as providing a global resource to help design, implement and interpret genomic studies in SSA populations and studies comprising globally diverse populations, complementing existing genomic resources. Specifically, we plan to carry out low and high depth whole genome sequencing of up to 2000 individuals across Africa (100 individuals from each ethnolinguistic group), and complement these data with 2.5M Illumina genotyping. We have already completed sequencing of 700 individuals across SSA, we are now adding an additional 540 samples from various ethno-linguistic groups within Africa, including populations from Burkina Faso, Morocco, Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa.Our scientific objectives are to: 1) develop a resource that provides a comprehensive catalogue of genetic variation in populations from SSA accessible to the global scientific community; 2) characterise population genetic diversity, structure, gene flow and admixture across SSA; 3) develop a cost-efficient, next-generation genotype array for diverse populations across SSA; and 4) facilitate whole genome-sequencing association studies of complex traits and diseases by developing a reference panel for imputation and resource for enhancing fine-mapping disease susceptibility loci. These scientific objectives will be supported by cross-cutting operational activities, including network and management of the consortium, research ethics, and research capacity building in statistical genetics and bioinformatics."

It is unknown to what extent tumor-derived miRs aredifferentially expressed between primary colorectal cancers (pCRCs) and metastatic lesions, and to what extent the expressionprofiles of tumor tissue differ from the surrounding normal tissue. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 220 fresh-frozen samples,including paired primary and metastatic tumor tissue and non-tumorous tissue from 38 patients, revealed expression of 2245known unique mature miRs and 515 novel candidate miRs. Unsupervised clustering of miR expression profiles of pCRC tissue withpaired metastases did not separate the two entities, whereas unsupervised clustering of miR expression profiles of pCRC withnormal colorectal mucosa demonstrated complete separation of the tumor samples from their paired normal mucosa. Twohundred and twenty-two miRs differentiated both pCRC and metastases from normal tissue samples (false discovery rate (FDR)o0.05). The highest expressed tumor-specific miRs were miR-21 and miR-92a, both previously described to be involved in CRC withpotential as circulating biomarker for early detection. Only eight miRs, 0.5% of the analysed miR transcriptome, were differentiallyexpressed between pCRC and the corresponding metastases (FDR o0.1), consisting of five known miRs (miR-320b, miR-320d,miR-3117, miR-1246 and miR-663b) and three novel candidate miRs (chr 1-2552-5p, chr 8-20656-5p and chr 10-25333-3p). Theseresults indicate that previously unrecognized candidate miRs expressed in advanced CRC were identified using NGS. In addition,miR expression profiles of pCRC and metastatic lesions are highly comparable and may be of similar predictive value for prognosisor response to treatment in patients with advanced CRC"

EGAS00001002480, link  centrosome cohesion defects  genome instability unveiled  crocc deficiency  lethal human cancers,"The century-old hypothesis on the role of centrosome in cancer remains unresolved. We show that reduced dosage of CROCC, a centrosomal-linker component required for centrosome cohesion and separation, due to mutation or allelic loss at 1p36.13 results in impaired centrosome phenotypes and monopolar mitotic forms characterizing a lethal subset of human colorectal cancers with rhabdoid phenotype. Interfering with CROCC in near-diploid colon cancer cells disrupts bipolar mitotic spindle architecture, and causes unequal DNA segregation errors to daughter cells resulting in a highly aggressive rhabdoid-like phenotype in vitro. Conversely, CROCC restoration in a metastatic cellular model harboring 1p36.13 deletion results in correction of centrosome segregation errors and cell death, revealing a mechanism of tolerance to gross mitotic errors and tetraploidization, two hallmarks of chromosomal instability. Our data shed light on a previously unknown link between centrosome cohesion apparatus and lethal cancer phenotypes providing new insight into pathways underlying genome instability."

However, previous studies with plasma DNA from patients with cancer demonstrated highly variable allele frequencies of ctDNA. The comprehensive analysis of tumor genomes is greatly facilitated when plasma DNA has increased amounts of ctDNA. Therefore, a fast and cost-effective pre-screening method to identify such plasma samples without previous knowledge about alterations in the respective tumor genome could assist in the selection of samples suitable for further extensive qualitative analysis. To address this, we adapted the recently described FAST-SeqS method, which was originally established as a simple and effective, non-invasive screening method for fetal aneuploidy from maternal blood. We show that our modified FAST-SeqS method (mFAST-SeqS) can be used as a pre-screening tool for an estimation of the ctDNA percentage. Using a combined evaluation of genome-wide and chromosome-arm specific z-scores from dilution series with cell line DNA and by comparisons of plasma-Seq profiles with data from mFAST-SeqS, we established a detection limit of 10% or more of mutant alleles. Plasma samples with an mFAST-SeqS z-score above 5 showed highly concordant results compared to copy number profiles obtained from our previously described plasma-Seq approach."

In addition to single variant tests we incorporated information on the predicted functional consequences of PAVs and analysed sets of genes with a higher likelihood of having a role in glioma on the basis of the profile of somatic mutations documented by large-scale sequencing initiatives. Globally tThere was a strong relationship between effect size and SNPs predicted to be damaging (P=2.29x10-49); however, these variants which are most likely to impact on risk, are rare (MAF&lt;5%). While no single variant showed an association which was statistically significant at the genomewide threshold a number of represented promising Notable associations - were seen with the BRCA2:c.9976A&gt;T, p.(Lys3326Ter)BRCA2 p.Lys332X variant,  which has been shown documented to influence breast and lung cancer risks (OR=2.3, P=4.00x10-4 for glioblastoma [GBM]) and IDH2:c.782G&gt;A, p.(Arg261His)IDH2 p.Arg261His (OR=3.21, P=7.67x10-3, for non-GBM).

Since the nuclear DNA of MZ twins is identical, our study provides a unique setting to functionally associate unique mtDNA variants and skewed heteroplasmy with MS development. In order to identify mtDNA variants in the twin cohort, we deeply sequenced the mitochondrial genome in blood of all 49 MZ twin pairs using next generation sequencing (Illumina, HiSeq or MiSeq) with an average coverage depth of ~25,000 sequences per base. Heteroplasmic variants were validated using targeted deep sequencing (TDS) (Illumina, MiSeq) in DNA isolated from blood and buccal swabs. In addition, whole blood was also available of 5 additional MS-affected or healthy siblings and 1 dizygotic twin pair discordant for MS, comprising in total 6 non-identical sib pairs. Moreover, all cases were screened for pathogenic mtDNA polymerase gamma (POLG) mutations.

We integrated whole genome (n=15), exome, copy number, gene expression and methylation analyses to comprehensively interrogate 64 ATRTs and observed that structural events were relatively frequent in the ATRT genome (~3 tumour).  In addition to SMARCB1, which was targeted by structural events in a majority (49/64) of tumours, recurrent structural alterations targeting the LRP1B, CDH13, BCR and MKL1 loci were observed. We observed novel translocation events, including 2 targeting SMARCB1 which were detected only by NGS analyses. Significantly, integration of gene expression and methylation profiles with genomic analyses revealed ATRT comprise two sub-groups with distinct clinical and genetic features.  Group 1 tumours were characterized by supra-tentorial brain location, focal intragenic alterations of SMARCB1 and a pro-neural gene expression signature with evidence of NOTCH pathway activation.  While Group 2 ATRTs were characterized by infra-tentorial brain location, broad SMARCB1 alterations and an activation of the BMP signalling pathway.

EGAS00001001427,trans ethnic genome wide association study identifies 12 genetic loci influencing blood pressure  implicates  role  dna methylation,"We carried out a trans-ethnic genome-wide association and replication study of blood pressure phenotypes amongst up to 320,251 individuals of East Asian, European and South Asian ancestry. We find genetic variants at 12 novel loci to be associated with blood pressure (P=3.9x10-11 to P=5.0x10-21). The sentinel blood pressure SNPs are enriched for association with DNA methylation at multiple nearby CpG sites, suggesting that at some of the loci identified DNA methylation may lie on the regulatory pathway linking sequence variation to blood pressure. The sentinel SNPs at the 12 novel loci point to genes involved in vascular smooth muscle (IGFBP3, KCNK3, PDE3A and PRDM6) and renal (ARHGAP24, OSR1, SLC22A7, TBX2) function. The novel and known genetic variants predict increased left ventricular mass, circulating levels of NT-proBNP, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (P=0.04 to 8.6x10-6). Our results provide new evidence for the role of DNA methylation in blood pressure regulation."

A genome-wide association study of 259 uveal melanoma patients compared to 401 controls all of European ancestry revealed a candidate locus at chromosome 5p15.33 (region rs421284: OR = 1.7, CI 1.43-2.05). This locus was replicated in an independent set of 276 cases and 184 controls. In addition, risk variants from this region were positively associated with higher expression of CLPTM1L. In conclusion, the CLPTM1L region contains risk alleles for uveal melanoma susceptibility, suggesting that CLPTM1L could play a role in uveal melanoma oncogenesis."

EGAS00001000737, generation sequencing  rna  dna isolated  paired fresh frozen  formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples  human cancer  normal tissue,"Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are an invaluable resource for clinical research. However, nucleic acids extracted from FFPE tissues are fragmented and chemically modified making them challenging to use in molecular studies. We analysed 23 fresh-frozen (FF), 35 FFPE and 38 paired FF/FFPE specimens, representing six different human tissue types (bladder, prostate and colon carcinoma; liver and colon normal tissue; reactive tonsil) in order to examine the potential use of FFPE samples in next-generation sequencing (NGS) based retrospective and prospective clinical studies. Two methods for DNA and three methods for RNA extraction from FFPE tissues were compared and were found to affect nucleic acid quantity and quality. DNA and RNA from selected FFPE and paired FF/FFPE specimens were used for exome and transcriptome analysis. Preparations of DNA Exome-Seq libraries was more challenging (29.5 % success) than that of RNA-Seq libraries, presumably because of modifications to FFPE tissue-derived DNA. Libraries could still be prepared from RNA isolated from two-decade old FFPE tissues. Data were analysed using the CLC Bio Genomics Workbench and revealed systematic differences between FF and FFPE tissue-derived nucleic acid libraries. In spite of this, pairwise analysis of DNA Exome-Seq data showed concordance for 70-80 % of variants in FF and FFPE samples stored for fewer than three years. RNA-Seq data showed high correlation of expression profiles in FF/FFPE pairs (Pearson Correlations of 0.90 +/- 0.05), irrespective of storage time (up to 244 months) and tissue type. A common set of 1,494 genes was identified with expression profiles that were significantly different between paired FF and FFPE samples irrespective of tissue type. Our results are promising and suggest that NGS can be used to study FFPE specimens in both prospective and retrospective archive-based studies in which FF specimens are not available."

In addition to single variant tests we incorporated information on the predicted functional consequences of PAVs and analysed sets of genes with a higher likelihood of having a role in glioma on the basis of the profile of somatic mutations documented by large-scale sequencing initiatives. Globally tThere was a strong relationship between effect size and SNPs predicted to be damaging (P=2.29x10-49); however, these variants which are most likely to impact on risk, are rare (MAF&lt;5%). While no single variant showed an association which was statistically significant at the genomewide threshold a number of represented promising Notable associations - were seen with the BRCA2:c.9976A&gt;T, p.(Lys3326Ter)BRCA2 p.Lys332X variant,  which has been shown documented to influence breast and lung cancer risks (OR=2.3, P=4.00x10-4 for glioblastoma [GBM]) and IDH2:c.782G&gt;A, p.(Arg261His)IDH2 p.Arg261His (OR=3.21, P=7.67x10-3, for non-GBM). Additionally, gene burden tests revealed a statistically significant association for HARS2 and risk of GBM (P=2.20x10-6). Genome scans of low frequency PAVs represent a complementary strategy to identify disease-causing variants compared with scans based on tagSNPs. Strategies to lessen the multiple testing burden by restricting analysis to PAVs with higher priors affords an opportunity to maximise study power."

Here we perform whole exome sequencing of 42 TGCTs to comprehensively study the mutational profile of TGCT.  The mutation rate is uniformly low in all of the tumours (mean 0.5 mutations per megabase [Mb]) as compared to the common cancers, consistent with the embryological origin of TGCT. In addition to expected copy number gain of chromosome 12p and mutation of KIT we identify recurrent mutations in the tumour suppressor gene CDC27 (11.9%). Copy number analysis reveals recurring amplification of the spermatocyte development gene FSIP2 (15.3%) and a 0.4Mb region at Xq28 (15.3%). Two treatment-refractory patients are shown to harbour XRCC2 mutations, a gene strongly implicated in defining cisplatin resistance.

EGAS00001000761,rnaseq data  study prpf6 regulated splice forms  colon cancer cell lines,"Alternative splicing plays critical roles in differentiation, development, and cancer (Pettigrew et al., 2008; Chen and Manley, 2009). The recent identification of specific spliceosome inhibitors has generated interest in the therapeutic potential of targeting this cellular process (van Alphen et al., 2009). Using an integrated genomic approach, we have identified PRPF6, an RNA binding component of the pre-mRNA spliceosome, as an essential driver of oncogenesis in colon cancer. Importantly, PRPF6 is both amplified and overexpressed in colon cancer, and only colon cancer cells with high PRPF6 levels are sensitive to its loss. Our data clearly point to an important role for PRPF6 in colon cancer growth and suggest that a better understanding of its role in alternative splicing in colon cancer is warranted. To determine the specific alternative splice forms that PRPF6 regulates in colon cancer, we plan three experiments: 1. The first involves knocking down expression of PRPF6 in two different cancer cell lines with 3 different siRNAs, and then completing RNA-seq to determine the gene expression changes that occur relative to a non-targeting control siRNA. Because of the role for PRPF6 in pre-mRNA splicing, we especially want to quantify the changes in splice-specific forms of all genes genome-wide to identify genes whose splicing is altered upon PRPF6 knockdown. 2. The second involves immunoprecipitating PRPF6 from two different cancer cell lines and isolating any RNA that is bound to PRPF6, since PRPF6 is an RNA-binding protein. We then want to carry out RNA-seq to identify which RNA molecules co-immunoprecipitated with PRPF6. This will help us determine possible functions for PRPF6 in regulating colon cancer growth. 3. The third involves overexpressing PRPF6 in cell lines and then carrying out RNA-seq to identify any changes in splice-specific gene expression. This will allow us to determine whether increased PRPF6 expression is sufficient to drive alternative splicing changes."

To identify endogenous molecules and specific genetic factors associated with appendicular lean mass (APLM) in the general population, cross-sectional data from the TwinsUK Adult Twin Registry was used. Non-targeted mass spec-based metabolomic profiling was performed on plasma of 3953 females (mostly dizygotic and monozygotic twins). APLM was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and genotyping was genome-wide (GWAS). Specific metabolites were used as intermediate phenotypes in the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with APLM using GWAS. 162 metabolites were found significantly correlated with APLM, and explained 17.4% of its variation. However, the top three of them (unidentified substance X12063, urate and mannose) explained 11.1% (p≤9.25*10-26) so each was subjected to GWAS. Each metabolite showed highly significant (p≤9.28*10-46) associations with genetic variants in the corresponding genomic regions. Mendelian randomization using these SNPs found no evidence for a direct causal effect of these metabolites on APLM. However, using a new software platform for bivariate analysis we showed that shared genetic factors contribute significantly (p≤4.31*10-43) to variance in both the metabolites and APLM - independent of the effect of the associated SNPs. There are several metabolites, having a clear pattern of genetic inheritance, which are highly significantly associated with APLM and may provide a cheap and readily accessible biomarker of muscle mass. However, the mechanism by which the genetic factor influences muscle mass remains to be discovered."

We thus performed paired whole genome sequencing of a metastatic melanoma cell line (COLO829) and a matched lymphoblastoid line (COLO829BL) across three institutions (TGen, Illumina, Genome Sciences Centre at the British Columbia Cancer Agency). We performed a meta-analysis of all data, in combination with the originally reported analysis of these cell lines by Pleasance et al (PMID: 20016485), and report a somatic reference standard based on consensus events. DNA extractions, library preparation, sequencing, and analysis were separately performed at each site. Results were compiled with sequence data previously generated for the cell lines to identify true positive variants, collectively representing a somatic reference standard. Overall, common somatic events include point mutations, small insertion/deletions, and genes affected by concurrent copy number changes.

EGAS00001000952,dynamics  genomic clones  breast cancer patient xenografts  single cell resolution,"Human cancers, including breast cancers, are comprised of clones differing in mutation content that evolve dynamically in space and time following principles of Darwinian evolution, underpinning important emergent features such as drug resistance and metastasis. Human breast cancer xenoengraftment is used as a means of capturing and studying tumour biology, and breast tumour xenografts are generally assumed to be reasonable models of the originating tumours. However the consequences and reproducibility of engraftment and propagation on the genomic clonal architecture of tumours has not been systematically examined at single cell resolution. Here we show by both deep genome and single cell sequencing methods, the clonal dynamics of initial engraftment and subsequent serial propagation of primary and metastatic human breast cancers in immunodeficient mice. In all cases examined, clonal selection on engraftment was observed in both primary and metastatic breast tumours, varying in degree from extreme selective engraftment of minor (&lt;5% of starting population) clones to moderate, polyclonal engraftment. Furthermore, ongoing clonal dynamics during serial passaging is a feature of tumours experiencing modest initial selection. Through single cell sequencing, we show that major mutation clusters estimated from tumour population sequencing relate predictably to the most abundant clonal genotypes, even in clonally complex and rapidly evolving cases. Finally, we show that similar clonal expansion patterns can emerge in independent grafts of the same starting tumour population, indicating that genomic aberrations can be reproducible determinants of evolutionary trajectories. Our results show that measurement of genomically defined clonal population dynamics will be highly informative for functional studies utilizing patient-derived breast cancer xenoengraftment."

Dutch biobanks played a substantial role in these discoveries. For most of these variants, however, the mechanisms through which they contribute to these phenotypes remain unknown. The BIOS Consortium applies a functional genomics approach that integrates genome-wide genetic data with data on the epigenome and transcriptome to elucidate these mechanisms. Over 4000 samples from BBMRI-NL biobanks with in-depth information on disease phenotypes and GWAS data are being enriched with RNA-sequencing and genome-wide DNA methylation data. The same is true for samples with whole-genome sequencing data from GoNL. This unique data infrastructure provides a powerful platform to evaluate key questions in integrative omics from establishing comprehensive eQTL and meQTL catalogues to linking molecular pathways across omics levels to phenotypic outcomes."

EGAS00001001225,analysis  lowfrequency coding variants  cardiometabolic traits,"The new round of meta-analysis in CAD/MI undertaken currently by CARDIoGRAMplusC4D which I am leading, has brought the total number of confirmed genome wide significant loci to 44 but as seen for other common diseases they collectively explain a modest  fraction of the genetic component. We have start seeing evidence of multiple independent variants among several of the 26 CAD loci that are undergoing fine mappping. Similarly in the lipid consortium a further 88 new loci have been identified in the current round bringing the total to over 180. Low frequency variants on the Metabochip were selected from an early release of the 1000 genomes project and therefore assessing the contribution of such variants to disease risk is incomplete.Based on a SNP set derived from 12,000 exomes and whole genomes an iSELECT array of circa 250,000 markers is been generated. The array will include mainly exonic SNPs (~246K) of which ~145 are non-synonymous. Inclusion criteria consisted of a SNP to be seen in at least 3 individuals and across at least two data sets.  Although most of the contributed data sets correspond to healthy individuals there was inclusion of variants derived from a few disease oriented exome studies one of which is the NHLBI funded effort on myocardial infarction. In addition, the exome array will include the most up to date GWA / metabochip hits from several consortia including GLGC( lipid) and CARDIoGRAMplusC4D (coronary artery disease (CAD)). The array includes some generic marker sets e.g. HLA, mitDNA, Y chromosome etc.The exome array provides an excellent opportunity to interrogate in a comprehensive way coding variants at the genome level including low frequency ones at a rather low cost. Availability of large sample collections will be essential to assess the impact of low frequency variants to disease risk. I am proposing a study to test the exome marker set for lipids and CAD/MI in 16000 people (5500 cases and 10,000 (possibly more) controls).I will seek validation of initial findings through CARDIoGRAMplusC4D which comprises over 60,000 CAD/MI cases and 120,000 controlsThe study will combine data generated as part of the WTCCC /UK exome consortium with data on 5000 samples (to include 4000 CAD/MI cases) for which I am requesting core funding under Aim 1.1 of Project 3: Genetics of Common Diseases. The 5000 samples include (i) 2000 CAD/MI cases from the EPIC-Norfolk cohort (ii) 1000 CAD/MI cases from the BHF collection and (iii) our Greek cohort THISEAS (1000 cases and 1000 controls) which has data on multiple cardiometabolic traits.  UK controls will come from the UK exome consortium effort to build a large UK control set. This effort which includes WTCCC investigators and a few other UK groups (cancer, lung function, Alzheimer's) aims to type up to 15,000 controls - WTCCC is funding 9,500 of the controls.  The selection of UK control sets is currently under discussion but one of the criteria is availability of other phenotypes and the 1958 British Birth Cohort (6500 samples) had unanimous support. Other relevant cohorts are: UKBloodService (3K), GRAPHIC (2K), Cambridge bioresource (8K), Oxford Biobank (3K), and Twins UK (6K). Finally, WTCCC is funding 1500 cases per participating disease phenotype; the 1500 CAD allocation (represented by Nilesh Samani and myself) will bring the total number of cases to 5500.Such a data set will not only drive the initial analysis round but will allow participation in subsequent meta-analyses as well as contributions in parallel international efforts e.g haematological and anthropometric traits, blood pressure, etc"

Here, we apply targeted whole exome sequencing (WES) to patients with unexplained limb-girdle weakness. This approach should increase the diagnostic rates of limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, contribute to the healthcare of affected patients, and expand existing genotype-phenotype correlations. One thousand patients were recruited by clinicians throughout Europe. Inclusion criteria stipulated that patients must be &gt;10 years of age at onset, presenting with limb-girdle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase activity. Phenotypic data was collected using PhenoTips, and WES was completed at the Broad Institute using an Illumina exome capture and a 38 Mb baited target with &gt;250 ng DNA. The variant call set was uploaded onto xBrowse and an analysis of 169 candidate genes for limb-girdle weakness was performed. The analysis of &gt;500 patient samples from 21 countries is now complete; the remaining analyses are ongoing. We have annotated causal variants in 42% of these patients, with mutations identified in 52 of the 169 candidate genes. Causal variants were most frequently identified in CAPN3 (LGMD2A), RYR1 (central core disease) and DYSF (LGMD2B). Of particular interest was the identification of a TTN founder mutation (LGMD2J) in a Serbian sub-population. Variants associated with treatable conditions, such as Pompe disease and congenital myasthenic syndromes, were detected in 15 patients. Implementing WES enabled the identification of causal variants in previously undiagnosed patients with muscle weakness, in some cases leading to the treatment of debilitating diseases. We have also expanded the understanding of genotype-phenotype correlations. Our data continues to highlight the value of WES in diagnosing rare neuromuscular diseases, and presents scope to further investigate the remaining unsolved cases."

To understand the molecular distinctions and their therapeutic relevance specific to Cell-of-Origin (COO) in DLBCL, for the first time we performed an integrative genomic and transcriptomic analysis of biopsies from a large population registry-based cohort of uniformly treated patients with de novo DLBCL. We identified that NFATC1 amplification was significantly enriched in ABC-DLBCL with prognostic significance. Distinct impact of copy number alterations on PI3K-AKT signaling pathway gene expression was observed in GCB-DLBCL relative to ABC-DLBCL. Furthermore, deletions of INPP4B and PTEN (implicating disrupted PI3K-AKT signaling), as well as activated phosphorylation of AKT were indicators of poor prognosis in GCB-DLBCL, suggesting a potential therapeutic target in this subtype. Finally, genome-wide analysis revealed chromosomal instability stratifies clinically and genetically distinct subgroups in DLBCL, which were associated with distinct tumor immune microenvironments across COO subtypes."

Structural variants and copy number variation (CNV) analysis of the 5 BCR-ABL1/BCR-ABL1-like cases enabled the base-pair resolution detection of the breakpoints. Somatic variants were determined by directly comparing the WES data of the tumor material to WES data of the remission specimen.

Thorough analysis of the breakpoints revealed that they are characterized by proximal cryptic recombination signal sequence (cRSS) motifs. Additionally, these breakpoint loci are enriched for active chromatin markers analogous to antigen regions undergoing V(D)J rearrangements. Exhaustive mutations detection revealed complex insertion-deletion (indel) mutations in certain cRSS motifs as a consequence of erroneous cleavage by the RAG complex and subsequent error-prone non-homologous end joining repair. This novel mechanism of mutagenesis is revealed to recurrently target BTLA in these 5 BCR-ABL1/BCR-ABL1-like ALL cases."

EGAS00001000127,uk10k rare coloboma,"In the UK10K project we propose a series of complementary genetic approaches to find new low frequency/rare variants contributing to disease phenotypes. These will be based on obtaining the genome wide sequence of 4000 samples from the TwinsUK and ALSPAC cohorts (at 6x sequence coverage), and the exome sequence (protein coding regions and related conserved sequence) of 6000 samples selected for extreme phenotypes. Our studies will focus primarily on cardiovascular-related quantitative traits, obesity and related metabolic traits, neurodevelopmental disorders and a limited number of extreme clinical phenotypes that will provide proof-of-concept for future familial trait sequencing.  We will analyse directly quantitative traits in the cohorts and the selected traits in the extreme samples, and also use imputation down to 0.1% allele frequency to extend the analyses to further sample sets with genome wide genotype data. In each case we will investigate indels and larger structural variants as well as SNPs, and use statistical methods that combine rare variants in a locus or pathway as well as single-variant approaches. Ocular coloboma is the most common significant developmental eye defect with an incidence of ~1 in 5,000 live births. It results from failure of optic fissure closure during embryogenesis. The position and extent of the fusion failure dictates the clinical appearance and functional effect. ~30% of coloboma cases are associated with other systemic malformations. These UK10K samples will mostly comprise isolated coloboma cases without systemic involvement (aka non-syndromal coloboma). There is strong evidence from family studies that coloboma has a major genetic component with autosomal dominance being the most common pattern of inheritance. However, many cases are isolated or show complex patterns of familial clustering. The genes responsible for isolated coloboma are largely unknown, but in a small number of families mutations in SHH, CHX10, and PAX6 have been identified indicating marked genetic heterogeneity. Thus in addition to the clinical benefits of achieving a molecular diagnosis there are also major scientific advantages to identifying coloboma genes, as these are likely to provide insights into the complex process of optic fissure closure, that is critical to normal eye development. In the longer term, understanding the molecular basis of the disease may provide clues to therapeutic strategies.For further information with regard to this cohort please contact David Fitzpatrick (david.fitzpatrick@ed.ac.uk)."

Accordingly, important initial events and the cellular context in which they occur have been difficult to characterize. Using DNA barcoding, we now demonstrate the high efficiency with which both purified basal and luminal cells isolated directly from normal adult human mammary tissue can be rapidly transformed by a single oncogene (KRASG12D) resulting in the production within 8 weeks in vivo of serially transplantable, polyclonal, invasive ductal carcinomas that are phenotypically heterogeneous and transcriptionally distinct from the initial cells transduced. Barcoding also revealed a consistent dramatic change in the clonal content of passaged tumours. This system thus provides a powerful new platform for examining early events in the genesis, evolution and treatment response of malignant human mammary cells generated using defined mutations."

We analyzed 493 prostate cancer cases from the TCGA database and performed whole-genome plasma sequencing8-10 of 95 plasma samples derived from 43 patients with metastatic prostate cancer and 50 control samples from male individuals without malignant disease. Although the prostate cancer genome was reported to be characterized by relatively few focal chromosomal alterations11, we demonstrate that newly occurring focal amplifications are a driving force in the progression to lethal, metastatic prostate cancer. We identified established driver aberrations in a cancer-related gene in nearly all cases (97.7%), including driver gene fusions (TMPRSS2:ERG), driver focal deletions (PTEN, RYBP, SHQ1), and driver amplifications (AR, MYC). In serial plasma analyses of samples with comparable circulating tumor DNA allele frequency, we observed changes in focal amplifications in 40% of cases. The mean time interval between new alterations was 26.4 weeks (range: 5-52 weeks), suggesting that these copy number changes are rapid adaptations to selection pressure. In contrast to earlier reports that lethal metastatic disease is clonal12-14, we show that increase of neuron-specific enolase was accompanied by clonal pattern changes in the tumor genome. Our analyses have significant implications for the clinical management of prostate cancer."

These have been carefully selected to maximise the chances of finding pathogenic noncoding mutations. Specifically, we have selected probands who have no likely causal mutation within the coding region but who have a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation inherited from one parent in a known recessive developmental disorder gene, and whose phenotype is a good match for the typical phenotype caused by recessive variants in that gene. We suspect that these probands may have a heterozygous noncoding mutation on the other allele which reduces expression of the gene so that, together, these two mutations are effectively equivalent to a homozygous loss-of-function mutation. About a quarter of the probands have affected siblings and, if those siblings have been exome sequenced, we have checked that they are identical-by-descent in the region of the gene.  We propose to search in the promoter region, intronic and annotated regulatory regions around these genes of interest for rare variants inherited from the other parent (i.e. not the one who transmitted the loss-of-function variant), or de novo variants. If we find such variants, and demonstrate an enrichment of this compound heterozygous LoF noncoding mechanism above that expected by chance, we intend to follow up specific candidates by RNAseq and potentially CRISPR/Cas9 experiments.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic complex disease of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Patients with IBD can experience a wide range of symptoms, but the pathophysiological mechanisms that cause these individual differences in clinical presentation remain largely unknown. In consequence, IBD is currently classified into subtypes using clinical characteristics. If we are to develop a more targeted treatment approach, molecular subtypes of IBD need to be discovered that can be used as new drug targets. To achieve this, we need multiple layers of molecular data are generated from the same IBD patients.We initiated the 1000IBD project to prospectively follow more than 1000 IBD patients from the Northern provinces of the Netherlands. For these patients, we have collected a uniquely large number of phenotypes and generated multi-omics profiles. To date, 1,215 participants have been enrolled in the project and enrolment is on-going, with 609 patients being present in the first data release. Phenotype data collected for these participants includes information on dietary and environmental factors, drug responses, and adverse drug events. Genome information has been generated using genotyping (ImmunoChip, Global Screening Array and HumanExomeChip) and sequencing (whole exome sequencing and targeted resequencing of IBD susceptibility loci), transcriptome information generated using RNA-sequencing of intestinal biopsies and microbiome information generated using both sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and whole genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing.All molecular data generated within the 1000IBD project will be shared in multiple data on the European Genome-Phenome Archive (www.ega-archive.org). The first data release, will contain basic phenotypes for 609 participants, genotypes of 314 participants, gut microbiome data generated by tag sequencing the 16S gene of feces from 315 participants and intestinal biopsies from 107 participants, and gut microbiome metagenomic sequencing of feces of 355 participants . Future releases will comprise many more additional phenotypes and -omics data layers. 1000IBD data can be used by other researchers as a replication cohort, a dataset to test new software tools, or a dataset for applying new statistical models."

However, such studies of African populations are also likely to provide new opportunities to discover novel disease susceptibility loci and variants and refine gene–disease association signals. A systematic assessment of genetic diversity within Africa would facilitate genomic epidemiological studies in the region.The Genome Diversity in Africa Project (GDAP) will extend and expand the African Genome Variation (AGV) project, an international collaboration aimed to produce a comprehensive catalogue of human genetic variation in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Using a sequencing-based approach, GDA project aims to capture human genetic variation in Africa, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), structural variants, and haplotypes. This resource will make a substantial contribution to understanding patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations in Africa, as well as providing a global resource to help design, implement and interpret genomic studies in African populations and studies comprising globally diverse populations, complementing existing genomic resources. Specifically, we plan to carry out whole genome sequencing at high depth (30x) of up to 1000 individuals across Africa (25 individuals from each ethnolinguistic group). We have already completed sequencing from 5 ethno-linguistic groups and we are now adding others.Our scientific objectives are to: 1) develop a resource that provides a comprehensive catalogue of genetic variation in populations from Africa accessible to the global scientific community; 2) characterise population genetic diversity, structure, gene flow and admixture across Africa; 3) develop a cost-efficient, next-generation genotype array for diverse populations across Africa; and 4) facilitate whole genome-sequencing association studies of complex traits and diseases by developing a reference panel for imputation and resource for enhancing fine-mapping disease susceptibility loci. These scientific objectives will be supported by cross-cutting operational activities, including network and management of the consortium, research ethics, and research capacity building in statistical genetics and bioinformatics."

Interestingly, genetic approaches have resulted so far in only very few confirmed longevity associations. This observation emphasizes that mechanisms beyond genetics, such as environmental factors, play a fundamental role in this phenotype. To address both genetic and non-genetic factors, we conducted a large-scale RNA-seq-based expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) study with a subsequent heritability analysis. The study was performed on peripheral blood samples obtained from 244 individuals, collected by a Danish-German consortium, of which 57 were at least 90 years old."

Until 2007, RGNT was diagnosed as neuroepithelial disembryoplastic tumor 2. RGNT is composed by two distinct features: a glial component, with typical characteristics of pilocytic astrocytoma, and a component forming neurocytic rosettes, with eosinophilic regions positive for synaptophysin and/or perivascular rosettes. This rare tumor affects predominantly adult females (61%), with mean age around 32 years, typically originating in the fourth ventricle and/or aqueduct 1,3. Due to its usual indolent course it is considered a WHO grade I tumor 1. Hitherto, less than 100 cases are reported in the literature 4, most of them as case reports of MRI, histopathological and immunohistochemical findings 5-17. There are few molecular studies, with the only recurrent genetic alterations identified being PIK3CA 18-25 or FGFR1 mutations 26. Herein, we describe a 33-year-old man with RGNT arising in a peculiar location, namely the spinal cord. We further performed an extensive immunohistochemistry and molecular analysis, using array-CGH (aCGH), whole exome and cancer-related hotspot sequencing, in order to better understand its underlying biology."

A GBM library annotated with genomic information and drug response profiles may facilitate identification of therapeutic options. Towards this goal, we established 57 GBM patient-derived tumor cells and determined whether the specific genetic aberrations correlated with sensitivities to 60 cancer drugs. We found 36 statistically significant gene-drug response associations, including previously unrecognized linkage between EGFRvIII and ibrutinib. A GBM patient-specific gene- drug sensitivity screen identified that afatinib was one of the most effective drugs against this specific tumor, and the tumor exhibited a remarkable clinical response. Together, these data demonstrate the potential of rapid drug screening combined with genomic profiling for precision oncological treatment of GBM patients."
EGAS00001001464,classification  glioblastoma based  patient derived cell screening,"Temozolomide (TMZ) is an important component of first-line regimen for newly diagnosed IDH wild type primary glioblastomas (GBMs). The limited accuracy of MGMT promoter methylation in predicting benefit from TMZ has hampered clinical application. To allow better prospective selection of patients with a high likelihood of response to TMZ, the predictive value of in vitro susceptibility to TMZ using patient-derived GBM stem cells (GSC)-based screen was evaluated, and clinical relevance of the signature predictive of TMZ therapeutic benefit were validated. TMZ cytotoxicity testing of 35 GSCs from newly diagnosed GBMs showed differential responses to TMZ, stratifying GSCs into responders and non-responders. TMZ sensitivity in vitro was closely correlated with clinical benefits from TMZ in parental GBMs as well as the effects on clonogenic potential and xenografts growth. Subsequently, TMZ-sensitivity gene signature reflecting tumor responses to TMZ was finally identified using 35 matched pairs of primary and recurrent GBMs, which included 10 genes corresponding to up-regulation in TMZ-responder and a significant decrease during progression, and 136 genes corresponding to up-regulation in TMZ-non-responder and persistence throughout progression. This TMZ-sensitivity signature compared favorably to MGMT status as an outcome predictor in TMZ treated patients with newly-diagnosed IDH wild-type GBM from TCGA cohort. Finally, targeting phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway enriched in TMZ-non-responders potentiated cytotoxicity of TMZ in TMZ-resistant GSCs. Taken together, the combined use of preclinical TMZ testing on patient-derived GSCs and clinically relevant TMZ sensitivity signature for therapeutic decision guidance of newly diagnosed GBMs."

We will perform a series of differential gene expression analyses to identify genes where expression differs between the rapid responders and non-responders. All these individuals have been included in our recent 15X whole-genome sequencing study so we will also search for genetic variants that influence expression responses to anti-TNF therapy. We will combine our genetic and genomic data with clinical and questionnaire data to build predictive models of anti-TNF response. We also sequence 150 samples from ~50 individuals with serum available at day 0, day 2 and wk 14. We will use these data to investigate the early transcriptional responses to anti-TNF therapy and see if these correlate with those seen at wk14. We know that immunogenicity likely plays a role in primary non-response and loss of response, and we will use these datat see if we can detect early transcriptional signatures associated with these negative treatment outcomes.

The overall aim is to extend upon recent efforts, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and large scale meta-analyses. While they have proved successful at mapping genomic loci that influence human diseases, like type 2 diabetes, much of the heritability remains unexplained. In this study, we use next generation sequencing and genotyping technologies to query for lower frequency variants in the human genome. Thereby, allowing a deeper characterization of the spectrum of alleles associated with type 2 diabetes risk, and a better assessment of the genes that play a role in the etiology of type 2 diabetes development.  We studied 1,326 T2D cases and 1,331 normoglycemic controls from Northern and Central Europe (Sweden, Finland, UK, and Germany).  To efficiently characterize the entire genome sequence of each individual, we performed low-coverage (~5x) whole-genome sequencing, augmented by deep coverage (~100x) sequencing of the exome, and dense (2.5M) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping using the HumanOmni2.5 array.

Bumble bees represent a taxon with an intermediate level of eusociality within Hymenoptera. The clear division of reproduction between a single founding queen and the largely sterile workers is characteristic for highly eusocial species, whereas the morphological similarity between the bumble bee queen and the workers is typical for more primitively eusocial hymenopterans. Also, unlike other highly eusocial hymenopterans, division of labour among worker sub-castes is plastic and not predetermined by morphology or age. We conducted a differential expression analysis based on RNA-seq data from 11 combinations of developmental stage and caste to investigate how a single genome can produce the distinct castes of queens, workers and males in the buff-tailed bumble bee Bombus terrestris. Based on expression patterns, we found males to be the most distinct of all adult castes (2,411 transcripts differentially expressed compared to non-reproductive workers). However, only relatively few transcripts were differentially expressed between males and workers during development (larvae: 71, pupae: 162). This indicates the need for more distinct expression patterns to control behaviour and physiology in adults compared to those required to create different morphologies. Among the female castes, the expression of over ten times more transcripts differed significantly between reproductive workers and their non-reproductive sisters than when comparing reproductive workers to the mother queen. This suggests a strong shift towards a more queen-like behaviour and physiology when a worker becomes fertile. This is in contrast to findings for higher eusocial species, in which reproductive workers are more similar to non-reproductive workers than the queen."

We have started one of the largest genome-wide associationstudies of vaccine responses ever undertaken, which will provide unparalleled power toidentify the genetic factors associated with the response to all of the most commonly usedchildhood vaccines worldwide.  In the first phase we analysed 2,181,930 autosomal markersgenotyped in 1,391 Ugandan children enrolled in the Entebbe Mother and Baby cohort study.Strong Class II HLA associations were observed with response to diphtheria toxin, pertussistoxin, pertussis pertactin, and pertussis filamentous haemagglutinin adhesin and we havenow replicated these findings in 750 infants from South Africa and 350 infants from BurkinaFaso. No associations of genome-wide significance were observed in HLA with response totetanus toxin, or against attenuated measles or the conjugated Haemophilus influenzaevaccines. In addition to the planned addition of 620 infants recruited in Bangladesh outlined ina separate prelim we would also like to genotype an outstanding 260 individuals from SouthAfrica who were not genotyped in the first round owing to unavailability of the samples at thetime of genotyping. These samples are now available in-house and we have phenotype datafor all of these individuals.

All DNAs havealready undergone quality control and are ready to be processed.The results from this large-scale analysis will be used to understand why HLA is stronglyassociated with some, but not all, toxoid vaccine responses and to identify the other elementsof the immune system associated with inter-individual variability to response to multiplevaccines.

EGAS00001002507,atrx mutant neuroblastoma  sensitive  ezh2 inhibition  modulation  neuronal differentiation,"Mutations and structural alterations of the SWI/SNF-like chromatin remodeler ATRX have been reported at high frequency in a number of adult and pediatric tumors1. However, the consequences of ATRX (Alpha Thalassemia/Mental Retardation, X-linked) mutations in cancer and their underlying epigenetic sensitivities remain ill defined. Particularly intriguing are the large N-terminal deletions of ATRX in neuroblastoma that generate in-frame fusion (IFF) proteins1–3 devoid of key chromatin interaction domains. Here we demonstrate that neuroblastoma cells harbouring ATRX IFFs have distinct gene expression programs compared to neuroblastoma cells that are wild type for ATRX. This is due in part to H3K27me3-mediated silencing of REST (RE1 Silencing Transcription Factor) target genes involved in neuronal differentiation. In turn, we find that ATRX IFF cells display exquisite sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition in both adherent and tumorsphere conditions, due in part to derepression of neurogenesis genes, including REST targets. Examination of the epigenomic landscape of a pediatric neuroblastoma tumor harboring an ATRX IFF revealed that H3K27me3 occupies a subset of REST target genes that are transcriptionally silenced, and are sensitive to EZH2 inhibition in our cell-based assays. Thus, our study greatly advances our understanding of indolent neuroblastoma and identifies EZH2 inhibition as a potential therapy for patients with ATRX mutant disease. Further, these studies may be applicable to other ATRX mutant pediatric malignancies, particularly those carrying similar structural alterations of ATRX."

We aimed to develop a gene-based predictive model for pigmentation phenotypes in a realistic target population for forensic case work from Northern Germany. Our aim was to determine whether better prediction accuracy can be achieved, or fewer genetic markers may suffice, than in previously studied, genetically more heterogeneous populations. We investigated the association between eye, hair and skin colour, and 12 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from six genes. Our study comprised two samples of 300 and 100 individuals from Northern Germany who were carefully characterized with regard to pigmentation phenotypes. The first sample was used to select trait-associated SNPs whereas the second sample served to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and to quantify the predictive capability of the respective SNP genotypes. SNP rs12913832 in HERC2 was found to be strongly associated with blue eye colour (OR=15.6, p&lt;1.2•10-4) and to yield reasonable predictive power (90% sensitivity, 63% specificity). SNP associations with hair and skin colour were weaker and genotypes less predictive. A comparison to two recently published sets of markers to predict eye and hair colour revealed that the consideration of additional SNPs with weak to moderate effect increases the predictive power in Northern Germans for eye colour, but not for hair colour. In addition, fine phenotyping and differentiation of hair colour (light / dark and red tint / no red tint) were found to increase the number of significant genotype-phenotype associations."

EGAS00001002520,local  time statistics  processual ,"Background: Functional genomics in a processual analysis cover the time-dependent changes in transcriptomics and epigenetics before diagnosis of a disease, reflecting the changes in both life style and disease processes. The aim of this paper is to explore the dynamic, time-dependent mechanisms of the metastatic processes, using blood transcriptomics and including time in a continuous manner. For achieving this goal we develop new statistical methods based on statistics that are local in time.  Methods: The new statistical method, Local In Time Statistics (LITS), is based on calculating statistics in moving windows and randomization. The method has been tested for the analysis of a dataset that collectively provides information on the blood transcriptome up to eight years before breast cancer diagnosis. The dataset from the NOWAC Post-genome Cohort consists of 467 case-control pairs matched on birth year and time of blood sampling. The data for a pair is the difference in log2 gene expression between the case and control. The stratified analyses are based on important biological differences like metastatic versus non-metastatic cancer, and the mode of cancer detection, i.e. screening detected versus clinically detected cancers. The dataset was used for examining whether the gene expression profile varies between cases and controls, with time, or between cases with and without metastases. Results: The null hypotheses of no differences between cases and controls, no time-dependent changes, and no differences between different strata were all rejected. For screening detected cancers the probability of correct prediction of metastasis status was best in year 1 before diagnosis compared to year 3 and 4 before diagnosis for clinically detected cancers. The predictor was not very sensitive to the number of genes included.Conclusions: Using a new statistical method, LITS, we have demonstrated time-dependent changes of the blood transcriptome up to eight years before breast cancer diagnosis."

All these features result in severly altered visual acuity (&lt;0,1), absent depth perception and poor night vision.  People with albinism are primarily visually handicapped.  In addition, for some types of albinism, the visual phenotype can be presented with partial or total hypopigmentation, hence resulting in a secondary phenotype which can lead to skin cancer if skin is not adequately protected.  Recently a new syndrome has been described, FHONDA, with the same visual abnormalities of albinism but without pigment alteration.  The traditional classification differentiates Oculoculatenous albinism (OCA), where hypopigmentation involves hair, skin and eyes versus Ocular Albinism (OA), where hypopigmentation only affects the eyes.  These are non-sydrimic types of albinism.  Some syndromic forms (Hermansky-Pudlak=HPS, Chediak-Higashi=CHS) affect cells beyond pigment cells, present in the lungs, immune system, platelets and intestines, resulting in more severe phenotypes that can be fatal.  Mutations in at least 19 genes are assocaited with the corresponding types of albinism.  Most hospitals will only diagnose the most frequent cases using traditional Sanger, MLPA approaches.  Some will use CGH arrays.  We aim to diagnose all cases of albinism through the Albinochip proposal, which combines a Sequenom first step of known mutations combined with subsequent NGS approaches.  In some cases we fail to find a second mutation, these are good candidates for further full exome analyses.

Whilst frequent gene mutations in signaling pathways, including JAK-STAT, NOTCH and NF-κB, have also been defined, the spectrum of these mutations typically overlap with the closely-related diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A combination of discovery exome and extended targeted sequencing revealed recurrent somatic mutations in RRAGC uniquely enriched in FL patients (17%). More than half of the mutations preferentially co-occurred with ATP6V1B2 and ATP6AP1 mutations, components of the vacuolar H+-adenosine triphosphate ATPase (v-ATPase) known to be necessary for amino acid-dependent mTORC1 activation. RagC mutants increased raptor binding whilst rendering mTORC1 signaling resistant to amino acid deprivation through nucleotide-independent mechanisms.

EGAS00001000109,uk10k neuro aberdeen,"In the UK10K project we propose a series of complementary genetic approaches to find new low frequency/rare variants contributing to disease phenotypes. These will be based on obtaining the genome wide sequence of 4000 samples from the TwinsUK and ALSPAC cohorts (at 6x sequence coverage), and the exome sequence (protein coding regions and related conserved sequence) of 6000 samples selected for extreme phenotypes. Our studies will focus primarily on cardiovascular-related quantitative traits, obesity and related metabolic traits, neurodevelopmental disorders and a limited number of extreme clinical phenotypes that will provide proof-of-concept for future familial trait sequencing. We will analyse directly quantitative traits in the cohorts and the selected traits in the extreme samples, and also use imputation down to 0.1% allele frequency to extend the analyses to further sample sets with genome wide genotype data. In each case we will investigate indels and larger structural variants as well as SNPs, and use statistical methods that combine rare variants in a locus or pathway as well as single-variant approaches. This sample set comprises cases of schizophrenia with additional cognitive measurements, collected in Aberdeen, Scotland.For further information on the Aberdeen cohort please contact David St Clair (d.stclair@abdn.ac.uk)."

EGAS00001002406,bisulfite converted duplexes   strand specific detection  quantification  rare mutations,"The identification of mutations that are present at low frequencies in clinical samples is an essential component of precision medicine. The development of molecular barcoding for next generation sequencing has greatly enhanced the sensitivity of detecting such mutations by massively parallel sequencing. However, further improvements in specificity would be useful for a variety of applications. We herein describe a technology (BiSeqS) that can increase the specificity of sequencing by at least two orders of magnitude over and above that achieved with molecular barcoding and can be applied to any massively parallel sequencing instrument. BiSeqS employs bisulfite treatment to distinguish the two strands of molecularly barcoded DNA; its specificity arises from the requirement for the same mutation to be identified in both strands. Because no library preparation is required, the technology permits very efficient use of the template DNA as well as sequence reads, which are nearly all confined to the amplicons of interest. Such efficiency is critical for clinical samples, such as plasma, in which only tiny amounts of DNA are often available. We show here that BiSeqS can be applied to evaluate transversions, as well as small insertions or deletions, and can reliably detect one mutation among &gt;10,000 wild type molecules."

EGAS00001002492,genomic profiling reveals spatial intra tumour heterogeneity  follicular lymphoma,"Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an incurable indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) that behaves heterogeneously and is synonymous with the reciprocal translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21), leading to aberrant constitutive over-expression of BCL2 [ref]. High risk groups with poor overall survival include patients that transform to a high grade lymphoma, most commonly diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or progress early (within 2 years) of receiving treatment. Recently several studies have shed light on the diverse genomic landscape of FL, with frequently mutated genes including those involved in chromatin remodelling, (CREBBP, KMT2D, EZH2, EP300), immune modulation (TNFRSF14), JAK-STAT (STAT6, SOCS1), NF-ĸB (CARD11, MYD88, TNFAIP3) and mTORC1 signalling (RRAGC) [ref]. To date, the majority of these studies have either focussed on inter-patient genetic heterogeneity or established the extent of clonal heterogeneity as a patient’s tumour evolves over time. Furthermore, these temporal studies have alluded to the existence of a tumour-repopulating population (referred to as the common progenitor cell (CPC)) that evades treatment and acts as a reservoir, seeding each subsequent relapse and transformation event. Although these previous studies have illuminated the longitudinal clonal dynamics that occur in FL, our understanding of the degree of spatial or intra-tumour heterogeneity (ITH) that exists within an individual patient thus far remains limited. Earlier studies have predominantly focused on differences in cytological grade and immunophenotype between spatially separated lymph nodes and bone marrow, the most common site of extra-nodal involvement in FL, with genomic profiling restricted to examining somatic hypermutation patterns in IgVH genes [ref]. In contrast next generation sequencing has been increasingly utilised in solid organ malignancies to derive comprehensive genomic profiles from spatially separated sites. The seminal study by Gerlinger et al revealed profound differences in the genetic make-up between individual primary and metastatic sites of renal cell carcinoma [ref]. Significant heterogeneity has since been demonstrated both between and within lesions in the same patient in lung, pancreas and breast cancer with presumed driver mutations distributed within the “branches” of the evolutionary phylogenetic tree, suggesting that a single biopsy is incapable of capturing the full genomic heterogeneity of an individual’s malignancy [ref]. This geographical heterogeneity not only adds to the diverse pool of tumour subclones that may contribute to drug resistance mechanisms but importantly, presents a major obstacle for precision-based approaches focussed on targeting specific lesions within a single biopsy. In FL, the exponential increase in clinical trials using novel agents such as EZH2, PI3K and BTK inhibitors reflects this shift in cancer care and along with the development of molecular prognostic scores such as the m7-FLIPI highlights the clinical need to accurately define genomic alterations with clinical relevance. As the majority of FL patients manifest disseminated tumour involvement, we sought to uncover the extent and clinical importance of spatial heterogeneity in FL by comprehensively genetically profiling 22 synchronously removed spatially separated biopsies from 9 patients. Using a combination of whole exome and targeted deep sequencing, our results inferred the complex subclonal architecture within these tumours and the mutational differences between anatomical sites, demonstrating cases with significant intrinsic genetic diversity."

We performed whole-genome sequencing of 12 ETP ALL cases and assessed the frequency of the identified somatic mutations in 94 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cases. ETP ALL was characterized by activating mutations in genes regulating cytokine receptor and RAS signalling (67% of cases; NRAS, KRAS, FLT3, IL7R, JAK3, JAK1, SH2B3 and BRAF), inactivating lesions disrupting haematopoietic development (58%; GATA3, ETV6, RUNX1, IKZF1 and EP300) and histone-modifying genes (48%; EZH2, EED, SUZ12, SETD2 and EP300). We also identified new targets of recurrent mutation including DNM2, ECT2L and RELN. The mutational spectrum is similar to myeloid tumours, and moreover, the global transcriptional profile of ETP ALL was similar to that of normal and myeloid leukaemia haematopoietic stem cells. These findings suggest that addition of myeloid-directed therapies might improve the poor outcome of ETP ALL."

Here, we reveal various de novo mutations affecting two genes, PLXND1 and REV3L. The finding that de novo mutations can cause MBS will have considerable impact on further research, as well as in diagnostics. PLXND1 and REV3L represent totally unrelated pathways involved in hindbrain development: neural migration and DNA translesion synthesis, essential for the replication of endogenously damaged DNA. Interestingly, analysis of Plxnd1 and Rev3l-mutant mice revealed that both genetic defects converge at the facial branchiomotor nucleus, affecting either motoneuron migration or proliferation."

EGAS00001002256, functional network  gastric cancer associated splicing events controlled  dysregulated splicing factors,"Except for a few genes known to have oncogenic spliceforms in gastric cancer, the full scope of aberrant splicing in gastric oncogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we elucidated the alternative splicing events associated with gastric carcinogenesis and identified upstream regulators governing these events. We performed RNA-seq on 19 matched tumor/normal pairs and a panel of gastric cancer cell lines, and identified 361 tumor associated (TA) alternative splicing events (ASEs), which included known oncogenic ASEs in genes such as INSR, FGFR2, CD44 and KRAS. We further identified 8 splicing factors dysregulated in gastric tumors, the expression of which are correlated to the splice ratio of the TA ASEs. We thereby constructed a dysregulated splicing network in gastric cancer, consisting of alternative splicing changes correlated to their potential regulators. This network featured three potential regulatory modules centered around the splicing factors ESRP2, MBNL1 and PTPB1. Knockdown of each splicing factor led to the expected changes in splicing of approximately half of the ASEs assayed. Thus, dysregulation of the splicing factors indeed was the cause of many of the TA ASEs. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that genes affected by tumor associated splicing were pre-dominantly involved in cytoskeletal organization. Concordant with this, knockdown of the splicing factors regulating the TA ASEs led to the expected changes in trans-well migration activity. Thus, we have established for the first time a comprehensive splicing network that likely drives gastric tumor progression, based on which novel therapeutic targets can be identified for further evaluation."

We collected 40 cases of MEITL and 27 cases of EATL, formerly known as type I EATL, and comparatively investigated the T cell receptor (TCR) itself and associated signaling molecules using immunohistochemistry, amplicon deep sequencing and bisulfite pyrosequencing. The TCR showed a frequent γδ T cell derivation in MEITL (55%) and overall a predominant positive TCR phenotype in MEITL (88%) compared to the mainly silent TCR phenotype in EATL (65%). The immunohistochemical expression of the spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) turned out to be a distinctive feature of MEITL (95%) compared to EATL (0%). Aberrant SYK overexpression in MEITL is likely caused by hypomethylation of the SYK promoter, while no common mutations in the SYK gene or in its promoter could be detected. Using amplicon deep sequencing, mutations in DNMT3A, IDH2 and TET2 were infrequent events in MEITL and EATL. Immunohistochemical expression of linker for activation of T cells (LAT) subdivided MEITL into a LAT expressing subset (33%) and a LAT silent subset (67%) with a potentially earlier disease onset in LAT-positive MEITL."
EGAS00001001199,mincr   myc induced lncrna   modulate myc  transcriptional network  burkitt lymphoma cells,"Despite the established role of the transcription factor MYC in cancer, little is known about the involvement of lncRNAs in mediating MYC’s function. Here we have intersected RNA-sequencing data from MYC-inducible cell lines, from a cohort of 91 mature B-cell lymphomas and from sorted germinal-center B-cells. By this approach, we identified 13 lncRNAs differentially expressed in IG-MYC-positive Burkitt lymphoma and regulated by MYC in the model cell lines. Among them we focused on a lncRNA that we named MINCR, showing a strong correlation with MYC expression in MYC-positive lymphomas and in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. RNAi experiments showed that MINCR controls cellular viability by influencing the expression of MYC-regulated cell cycle genes. Finally we provide evidences that down-regulation of AURKA, AURKB and CTD1 may explain the reduction in cellular proliferation observed upon MINCR knock-down. We therefore suggest that MINCR acts as a modulator of MYC transcriptional control of cell cycle genes."
EGAS00001002446,periprostatic tissue   patients   high risk prostate cancer   distinct transcriptional profile,"Increasing evidence indicates that altered adipose tissue homeostasis may be an important contributor to the development and/or progression of prostate cancer. As prostate tumours progress locally they frequently invade the periprostatic adipose compartment, gaining access to locally produced adipokines that have been associated with tumour cell growth, invasion and metastases. In this study we investigate the adipose transcriptional profiles of high-risk and low-risk disease to determine both prognostic potential and possible biological drivers of aggressive disease. RNA was extracted from periprostatic adipose tissue taken from patients categorised as having prostate cancer with either a high- or low-risk of progression by the D'Amico classification system and profiled by RNAseq. A clear separation was observed between the transcriptional profiles of high-risk and low-risk prostate cancer in periprostatic adipose tissue and a 17-gene signature consisting of IGHA1, SAA2, MYH11, DES, RERGL, SOCS3, PLA2G2A, SLC2A1, COL6A6, GPR34, CLDN1, PCDH10, SELE, ACAN, OLFM4, KLF5, KIF25, was able to separate high- and low-risk disease.

Using a recursive partitioning approach, we identified 34,502 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with genetic background and/or developmental stimuli. Specifically, 23,792 DMRs (69%) were significantly associated with inter-individual variations, of which 82% were associated with genetic polymorphisms in cis. Notably, inter-individual variations further modified 57 of 212 (26%) developmental DMRs with transcriptomic responses. Our study presents a novel analytical approach to determine the bona fide genetic contribution embedded in outlier patterns of CpG-SNPs in individual methylomes. This approach can be used to study genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying differential responses to developmental stimuli, environmental changes, and inter-individual differences in drug responses."

In case of monogenic heritabledisease, background maternal cfDNA prohibits direct observation of the maternally inherited allele. Non-invasive prenatal diagnostics(NIPD) of monogenic diseases therefore relies on parental haplotyping and statistical assessment of inherited alleles from cffDNA,techniques currently unavailable for routine clinical practice. Here, we present monogenic NIPD (MG-NIPD), which requires a bloodsample from both parents, for targeted locus amplification (TLA)-based phasing of heterozygous variants selectively at a gene of interest.Capture probes-based targeted sequencing of cfDNA from the pregnant mother and a tailored statistical analysis enables predicting fetalgene inheritance. MG-NIPD was validated for 18 pregnancies, focusing on CFTR, CYP21A2, and HBB. In all cases we could predict theinherited alleles with &gt;98% confidence, even at relatively early stages (8 weeks) of pregnancy. This prediction and the accuracy ofparental haplotyping was confirmed by sequencing of fetal material obtained by parallel invasive procedures.

EGAS00001002540, depth characterization   mutational signature  cisplatin   human cell    tumors,"Cisplatin based chemotherapeutic regimens are the standard of care for many tumor types. As cisplatin reacts with DNA, it likely leaves a characteristic pattern of somatic mutations, called a mutational signature. Mutational signatures can provide insight into tumorigenesis and serve as biomarkers for mutagenic processes and exposures. Therefore we set out to generate the mutational signature of cisplatin in MCF10A, a normal human mammary epithelial cell line. We extensively characterized the mutations induced by cisplatin treatment and identified strongly preferred tri- and pentanucleotide contexts. Analysis of transcription strand bias was consistent with cisplatin adducts on both guanines and adenines. Numbers of small insertions and deletions were low, but the proportion of dinucleotide substitutions (DNSs) was high: &gt; 7% of single nucleotide substitutions were part of DNSs, likely related to the inter- and intra-strand crosslinks formed by cisplatin. Several bases were markedly enriched at sites flanking DNSs, and there was no observable transcriptional strand bias for DNSs. We identified evidence of cisplatin exposure in 6 out of 342 hepatocellular carcinoma genomes based on the single nucleotide and DNSs patterns. We also identified the single and dinucleotide signatures of cisplatin in 3 esophageal adenocarcinomas with known cisplatin exposure. We conclude that incorporating information such as dinucleotide spectra into mutational signature analysis is crucial for correct assignment of mutational signatures to tumors. Furthermore, we emphasize the need for standardization of protocols for studying mutagenic processes, in particular the in vitro models used."

Here, we present a framework for inferring cancer-related gene overexpression resulting from cis-regulatory element reorganization (e.g., enhancer hijacking), by integrating SCNAs, gene expression data, and information on chromatin interaction domains. Analysis of 7,416 cancer genomes uncovered several pan-cancer candidate genes, including IRS4, SMARCA1 and TERT. We demonstrate that IRS4 overexpression in lung cancer associates with recurrent deletions in cis, and present evidence supporting a tumor-promoting role. We additionally pursued cancer type-specific analyses, uncovering IGF2 as a target for enhancer hijacking in colorectal cancer. IGF2-containing tandem duplications result in the de novo formation of a 3D contact domain comprising IGF2 and a lineage-specific super-enhancer, which mediates high-level gene activation. Our framework enables systematic inference of cis-regulatory element rearrangements mediating dysregulation in cancer."

It identifies patients (16%) with very poor prognosis, with median time to progression 21.7 months (95% CI: 14.3-42.6) versus 70.9 months (95% CI: 41.5-95.0) for the remainder. The results suggest BTK as a potential target for treatment of high-risk FL-patients."

To discover new breast cancer susceptibility genes, we used two populations (Poland and Quebec, Canada) and applied whole exome sequencing in a discovery phase (n = 195), followed by validation of these findings. We identified rare recurrent RECQL mutations in each population. In Quebec, 7 of 1,013 higher-risk breast cancer cases and 1 of 7,136 newborns carried the c.634C&gt;T (p.Arg215Ter) variant (p = 0.00004).

EGAS00001002469,genome diversity  africa project luhya,"Globally, human populations show structured genetic diversity as a result of geographical dispersion, selection and drift. Understanding this genetic variation can provide insights into the evolutionary processes that shape both human adaptation and variation in disease. Populations from SSA have the highest levels of genetic diversity. This characteristic, in addition to historical genetic admixture, can lead to complexities in the design of studies assessing the genetic determinants of disease and human variation. However, such studies of African populations are also likely to provide new opportunities to discover novel disease susceptibility loci and variants and refine gene–disease association signals. A systematic assessment of genetic diversity within SSA would facilitate genomic epidemiological studies in the region. The Genome Diversity in Africa Project (GDAP) aims to produce a comprehensive catalogue of human genetic variation in SSA, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), structural variants, and haplotypes. This resource will make a substantial contribution to understanding patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations in SSA, as well as providing a global resource to help design, implement and interpret genomic studies in SSA populations and studies comprising globally diverse populations, complementing existing genomic resources. Specifically, we plan to carry out high depth whole genome sequencing of up to 2000 individuals across Africa (25 individuals from each ethnolinguistic group). Our scientific objectives are to: 1) develop a resource that provides a comprehensive catalogue of genetic variation in populations from SSA accessible to the global scientific community; 2) characterise population genetic diversity, structure, gene flow and admixture across SSA; 3) develop a cost-efficient, next-generation genotype array for diverse populations across SSA; and 4) facilitate whole genome-sequencing association studies of complex traits and diseases by developing a reference panel for imputation and resource for enhancing fine-mapping disease susceptibility loci. These scientific objectives will be supported by cross-cutting operational activities, including network and management of the consortium, research ethics, and research capacity building in statistical genetics and bioinformatics.

We identified 150 genetic drivers of DLBCL including many novel, clinically relevant genes (e.g. SPEN, SETD1B and KLHL14). Genetic drivers were highly enriched among essential genes identified by CRISPR screening in DLBCL cell lines including those of immediate potential therapeutic relevance such as MTOR, SYK, SF3B1 and XPO1. RHOA emerged as a critical driver gene from our genetic analysis and CRISPR screen; we further delineated its functional role in vitro and in vivo models to define its role as an essential oncogene in DLBCL.

Two additional SNPs, rs2736100 (TERT) and rs9376092 (HBS1L/MYB) achieve genome-wide significance when including JAK2V617F positive cases. rs9376092 has a stronger effect in JAK2V617F negative cases with CALR and/or MPL mutations (Breslow-Day P=4.5x10-7) whereas in JAK2V617F positive cases rs9376092 associates with essential thrombocythemia (ET) rather than polycythemia vera (allelic chi-square P=7.3x10-7). Reduced MYB expression, previously linked to development of an ET-like disease in model systems, associates with rs9376092 in normal myeloid cells.

Early tumour development is characterized by single nucleotide mutations, while later branching shows changes in trinucleotide mutational signatures and accumulation of copy number aberrations. Specific genes are selectively mutated either prior to or following branched evolution, including MTOR and NKX3-1 and RB1. Patients with monoclonal tumours showed superior outcomes relative to those with polyclonal tumours, and the presence of subclones confounds the accuracy of molecular prognostic assays.

They are defined by highly specific mutations in the gene encoding the histone H3.3 variant H3F3A2, occurring either at or close to key residues marked by methylation for regulation of transcription – K27 and G34. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation linked to next-generation whole genome sequencing (ChIP-Seq) for H3K36me3 in order to test the hypothesis that, rather than total H3K36me3, the G34V mutation may instead result in differential binding of the trimethyl mark throughout the genome. Compared with H3F3A wild-type SF188 paediatric GBM cells, H3K36me3 was found to be significantly differentially bound in KNS42 cells at 5130 distinct regions of the genome corresponding to 156 genes. Concurrent whole genome DNA sequencing demonstrated that this was not confounded by copy number alterations. The cerebral hemispheric-specific G34 mutation drives a distinct expression signature through differential genomic binding of the K36 trimethylation mark (H3K36me3). The transcriptional program induced recapitulates that of the developing forebrain, and involves numerous markers of stem cell maintenance, cell fate decisions and self-renewal. Critically, H3F3A G34 mutations cause profound upregulation of MYCN, a potent oncogene which is causative of glioblastomas when expressed in the correct developmental context. This driving aberration is selectively targetable in this patient population by inhibiting kinases responsible for stabilisation of the protein."

This study will also enable us to define to what extent primary tumour profiling can capture the biological processes operative in matched metastases as well as the significance of intratumoural heterogeneity."

EGAS00001002989,human psc derived bat rnaseq analysis,"Obesity and associated metabolic complications are major health problems. Here we propose a strategy focused on targeting the mechanisms controlling energy dissipation to create negative energy balance. The brown adipose tissue (BAT) is specialised in energy dissipation in response to environmental stimuli such as cold and increased lipid rich hypercaloric intake, a process referred as adaptive thermogenesis. This energy dissipating role of BAT is mediated by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). The relevance of BAT activation to energy balance is well established in murine models. The realisation that functional BAT is also found in adult humans is much more recent. An inverse relationship between adiposity, diabetes and BAT activity has been observed. These results support the concept that increasing a) BAT mass, b) activity o c) recruitment of beige cells could be a safe and efficient strategy to prevent or treat obesity and its associated complications. Current cellular and developmental models of adipogenesis have limited therapeutic potential and constrains the discovery of cell fate mechanisms involved in human BAT development. To surmount these issues, human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in vitro differentiation represents a promising complementary model of brown adipogenesis.
Within the pump-priming project “ES/IPS cells differentiation to brown/beige adipocytes as an anti-obesity strategy”, we developed a model of human PSC-derived brown adipose tissue progenitors (mesodermal, early, late progenitors) and of mature brown adipocyte.

EGAS00001000922,scoop human core exome genotyping,"Obesity is a major public health problem with substantial impacts on morbidity and mortality.Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for obesity-related traits have proven to be anextremely valuable tool leading to the discovery of over 50 loci to date (PMID:17434869,17496892,18454148, 18604207, 19151714, 20421936, 21708048, 20935630,21935397, 22484627). However, the variants identified explain only a small fraction of thevariance in BMI (body mass index).The SCOOP cohort (PMID: 23563609) is a UK Caucasian subset of the Genetics of ObesityStudy (GOOS) (PMID: 19966786], comprising of individuals with severe early-onset obesity(BMI standard deviation score (SDS) &gt; 3; onset of obesity before the age of 10 years). Werecently carried out an association analysis in 1,509 SCOOP cases and 5,380 populationcontrols, and successfully identified 4 new loci associated with severe obesity (LEPR,PRKCH, PACS1 and RMST) (PMID: 23563609).It is well established that large sample sizes are required to detect common variants withmodest effects. Rare variants may also explain a proportion of the missing heritability andmay be more readily identified at the extremes of a phenotypic distribution. We thereforepropose to build on the success of the previous GWAS, by genotyping and additional 3,500samples from the SCOOP cohort on the Illumina HumanCoreExome beadchip. This chip is ahigh-density array with increased coverage of exonic regions, enabling us to cost-effectivelysearch for both common &amp; rare variants contributing to severe obesity."

EGAS00001001246,biological indicators  resilience,"Individuals who have been exposed to acute or cumulative physical or mental traumas (e.g., body injury, pain, combat operations, terrorist attacks, bereavement, disagreement in significant relationships, financial and legal problems, dismissal from work, severe illness, and loss of a highly valued object) are at higher risk of developing anxiety, post-traumatic stress, major depressive or other psychiatric disorders with symptoms of chronic emotional distress and negative intrusive thoughts (fear of recurrence, magnification, rumination, and helplessness) and long-term disability in follow-up. However, not everyone develops negative symptoms after exposure to traumatic events, and individuals differ in the severity of symptoms and disability outcomes.  Researchers consider that such phenomenon as individual resilience or tolerance to a range of adverse events should explain these outcomes. Most researchers see no or only little difference in the concepts of ‘resilience’ and ‘adaptation’. However, these mechanisms could be related to fundamentally different biological processes, regulating flexibility and stability. Physiological resilience and adaptation work as two attractors for different physiological regulations in terms of the Chaos Theory. It extends our understanding of how disorders may be prevented in ways beyond adaptation. Resilience mechanisms are suggested to help (i) to protect an organism from transfer of adaptive reactivity to over-adaptation, which leads to ‘destroying’ one’s structural and functional organization as the main part of the aging process, (ii) to balance biological, psychological and social arousing effects in interaction with adaptation mechanisms for development of healthy trade-offs between tolerance and sensitivity to events, as a process of phenotyping a genetic range of predispositions in specific environments."
EGAS00001000918,genome wide association study  vaccine responses  infants living   developing  vaccgene phase ii african cohorts,"Human genetic heterogeneity accounts for approximately 70% of the observed variability inresponse to common childhood vaccinations. Identifying the elements of this heterogeneitywill enable the development of vaccines which have improved clinical and cost effectivenessthrough rational adjuventation approaches, or by targeting particular at-risk or responsivesubgroups. The studies published to date have been limited in terms of the number of vaccinesubtypes analysed, diversity of the populations included, sample sizes and breadth of otherenvironmental and lifestyle variables which may explain some of the remainder of variation inthe response to each vaccine. Nevertheless, these studies have proposed that the geneswhich harbour the variants associated with vaccine responsiveness reside within regions ofthe genome associated with immune function such as the HLA locus and FOXP1and ITGAL.We are proposing one of the largest genome-wide association studies of vaccine responseever undertaken, which will provide unparalleled power to identify the genetic factorsassociated with the response to all of the most commonly used childhood vaccinesworldwide. For the first phase of the project (Prelim I0308) we genotyped ca. 1,400 childrenfrom the Entebbe Mother and Baby (EMaB) study, an ongoing birth cohort in southernUganda, using the Illumina HumanOmni2.5-8 chip. Analyses for response to vaccinationagainst diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, measles, hepatitis B and BCGare now underway. Working alongside other ongoing studies, we plan for the second phaseof the project to expand sample sizes to up to 7,000 individuals in total. This large cohort willinclude 1,500 South African infants, 500 Burkina Faso infants, 1,800 children from Ecuadorand up to 1,800 from a variety of countries (MAL-ED Consortium). The principal measuredphenotypes will be the serological responses at 6 or 12 months of age to the vaccinesadministered to all enrolled children as part of expanded programme of immunisation in allcountries. As for the primary Ugandan study the responses will be analysed as quantitativetraits using mixed model (GEMMA) analyses following imputation using a combined 1000Genome and African Genome Variation Project reference panel. The data will be analysed asone large discovery mega-analysis to maximise the power of finding the relevant associatedvariants. Interim GWAS analyses will be performed on each population to test for populationspecific signals. Other phenotypes that will be assessed in the new studies includequantitative response to BCG, rotavirus and pneumococcal vaccines (South Africa, Ecuadorand Uganda), clinical and immunological response to malaria vaccines (Burkina),immunological correlates of atopy (Ecuador and Uganda) and malaria infection (Burkina,Ecuador and Uganda) in addition to non-communicable disease traits such as blood pressurepage 1[A8] If applicable, provide text (abstract) which will accompany data for this study in the ENA/EGA.[A9] Does this project use samples?[A10] Please choose which types of sample you will be using[A12] Please state the anticipated date (month/year) samples will be available in-house (if known).

Taken together with the TCGA PCa cohort, our integration analysis provides the first comprehensive mutational landscape of PCas across major ethnics worldwide and reveals potential novel role of frequent altered chromatin remodeler genes in PCas without androgen receptor (AR) alteration and complex rearrangements derived from Chromoplexy. In addition, we identified 5 putative tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) chains including one on chromosome 13q with novel findings of PCDH9 (deletions in 15/65 tumors) which was implicated in aggressive progression of prostate cancer. Finally, the integrative pathway and co-expression network analysis followed by the functional study indicated the frequent altered genes, particularly focal amplifications of PLXNA1 (11/65), in semaphoring signaling of axon guidance pathway may interact with PI3K/AKT and AR signaling and also contribute to the aggressiveness and progression of prostate cancer."

EGAS00001001252,engineering   promoterless anti viral rnai hairpin   endogenous mirna locus,"Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression strategies that allow safe and persistent target mRNA knockdown are key to the success of many in vitro or in vivo RNAi applications. Here, we propose a novel solution which is expression of a promoterless miRNA-adapted shRNA (shmiRNA) from an engineered genomic miRNA locus. For proof-of-concept, we genetically “vaccinated” liver cells against a human pathogen, by using TALEns or CRISPR to integrate an anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) shmiRNA into the liver-specific miR-122/hcr gene. Reporter assays and qRT-PCR confirmed anti-HCV shmiRNA expression as well as miR-122 integrity and functionality. Specificity and safety of shmiRNA integration were validated via PCR, cDNA and miRNA profiling, and whole genome sequencing. A subgenomic HCV replicon and a full-length reporter virus, but not a Dengue virus control, were significantly impaired in the modified cells. Our original combination of DNA engineering and RNAi expression technologies should benefit numerous applications, from basic miRNA research, to human cell and gene therapy."

EGAS00001002373,impact  rb1 genotype   mutational landscape  evolution  retinoblastoma,"Retinoblastoma is the most common eye tumour in children, and despite being highly curable, the primary treatment courses (enucleation or chemotherapy) severely impact patient well being and must be carefully chosen. Although retinoblastoma was one of the first tumours to provide clear insight into the genetic basis of cancer, its genomic underpinnings have not yet been fully resolved. The loss of tumour-suppressor gene RB is a main driving event in both hereditary and sporadic retinoblastoma, but this event alone cannot initiate a malignant tumour. A rare subset of retinoblastomas carry wildtype RB, and instead harbour amplification of the MYCN oncogene. However, not all RB1++ tumours carry a MYCN amplification, suggesting other mutations may contribute to pathogenicity. Here, we compare the mutational landscape and evolution of RB1++, RB1+-, and RB1-- retinoblastomas to explore how the presence or absence of a key driver event shapes somatic evolution of the genome. We find CNAs are largely consistent between RB1 genotype groups, but show clear evidence of heterogeneity among RB1-- patients, and uncover novel potential drivers within common chromosomal aberrations including NBAS, CENPF,DFFB, and CHDL1. In contrast, we observe differences in the frequency of coding poiunt mutations among RB1 genoytpe groups for genes including MUC4, EN1, YWAB, and PHF20l1 and further show mutational signatures differ between these groups. We also observe extensive structural rearrangements in both RB1+- and RB1++ samples, as well as evidence of chromothripsis in all samples, often enveloping RB or MYCN, highlighting the general importance of structural variants in retinoblastoma. Finally, we show subclonality is common among retinoblastoma samples, and find copy number aberrations, including RB1 loss and MYCN amplification, occur later in tumour evolution than point mutations. These findings suggest tumours with different RB1 genotypes can experience different mutational processes early in their evolution that manifest mainly through point mutations, but ultimately converge on similar evolutionary trajectories and structural aberrations. Evidence of subclonal structure within retinoblastoma cautions the use of targeted chemotherapy for treatment."

Given its prevalence in males, it was originally postulated to be X-linked. Whole genome sequencing revealed compound heterozygous rare variants disrupting highly conserved positions of the autosomal non-coding RNU4ATAC gene, a minor spliceosome component essential for minor intron splicing. Targeted sequencing confirmed allele segregation in six cases from four unrelated families. RNU4ATAC has been recently reported to cause Microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism, type I (MOPD1), whose phenotype is distinct from Roifman Syndrome. Strikingly, all the six Roifman Syndrome cases have one RNU4ATAC variant overlapping MOPD1-implicated structural elements, while the other variant overlaps a highly conserved element not previously implicated in disease. RNA-seq analysis confirmed defects of minor intron splicing. Available allele frequency data suggests that recessive genetic disorders caused by RNU4ATAC may be more prevalent than reported in the literature."

EGAS00001001101,modeling   human alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma pax3 foxo1 chromosome translocation  mouse myoblasts  crispr cas9 nuclease,"Many recurrent chromosome translocations in cancer result in the generation of fusion genes that are directly implicated in the tumorigenic process. Precise modeling of the effects of cancer fusion genes in mice has been inaccurate as constructs of fusion genes often completely or partially lack the correct regulatory sequences. The reciprocal t(2;13)(q36.1;q14.1) in human alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (A-RMS) creates a pathognomonic PAX3-FOXO1 fusion gene. In vivo mimicking of this translocation in mice is complicated by the fact that Pax3 and Foxo1 are in opposite orientation on their respective chromosomes, precluding formation of a functional Pax3-Foxo1 fusion via a simple translocation. To circumvent this problem we irreversibly inverted the orientation of a 4.9 Mb syntenic fragment on chromosome 3, encompassing Foxo1, by using Cre-mediated recombination of two pairs of unrelated oppositely oriented LoxP sites situated at the borders of the syntenic region. We tested if spatial proximity of the Pax3 and Foxo1 loci in myoblasts of mice homozygous for the inversion facilitated Pax3-Foxo1 fusion gene formation upon induction of targeted CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease-induced DNA double strand breaks in Pax3 and Foxo1. Fluorescent in situ hybridization indicated that fore limb myoblasts show a higher frequency of Pax3/Foxo1 co-localization than hind limb myoblasts.  Indeed, more fusion genes were generated in fore limb myoblasts via a reciprocal t(1;3), which expressed correctly spliced Pax3-Foxo1 mRNA encoding Pax3-Foxo1 fusion protein. We conclude that locus proximity facilitates chromosome translocation upon induction of DNA double strand breaks. Given that the Pax3-Foxo1 fusion gene will contain all the regulatory sequences necessary for precise regulation of its expression, we propose that CRISPR-Cas9 provides a novel means to faithfully model human diseases caused by chromosome translocation in mice."

Mutant IDH1 drives overproduction of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) and a CpG island (CGI) hypermethylation phenotype (G-CIMP). To investigate the role of mutant IDH1 at recurrence, we performed a longitudinal analysis of 50 IDH1 mutant LGGs. We discovered six cases with copy number alterations (CNAs) at the IDH1 locus at recurrence. Deletion or amplification of IDH1 was followed by clonal expansion and recurrence at a higher grade. Successful cultures derived from IDH1 mutant, but not IDH1 wild-type, gliomas systematically deleted IDH1 in vitro and in vivo, further suggestive of selection against the heterozygous mutant state as tumors progress. Tumors and cultures with IDH1 CNA had decreased 2HG, maintenance of G-CIMP, and DNA methylation reprogramming outside CGI. Thus, while IDH1 mutation initiates gliomagenesis, in some patients, mutant IDH1 and 2HG are not required for later clonal expansions."

EGAS00001001947,distinguishing indolent  aggressive ductal carcinoma  situ dcis pilot,"With the widespread adoption of breast screening, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has come to represent 20-25% of breast neoplasia diagnosed through screening, some 8,000 women annually in the UK, 2,400 in the Netherlands, and over 60,000 women per year in the US. Conventional management  includes surgery, supplemented by radiotherapy and/or endocrine therapy, but over-treats the majority of DCIS as ~1% recur annually and breast cancer mortality is ~3% at 20 years. Uncertainty as to which DCIS lesions will progress to invasive cancer or, after excision, which will return with recurrent DCIS or invasive breast cancer drives this overtreatment. Characterisation of the DCIS with lethal potential from the majority of non-lethal DCIS would impact on a significant proportion of the tens of thousands of women in the UK and globally who currently undergo radical treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy), without a survival benefit, but bear the lifelong consequences of therapy.

The pressing need is therefore to distinguish the relatively small proportion of women with DCIS who will
subsequently die of (invasive) breast cancer from the majority with DCIS who are currently overtreated. Thus, to distinguish aggressive from indolent DCIS we will develop, cross-validate, and prospectively test molecular markers utilising clinical material available from retrospective and prospective clinical studies in the UK, Europe and US."

EGAS00001002051,h034 mutational landscape  colorectal cancer liver metastases,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of cancer morbidity and mortality worldwide and remains the fourth common cause of death from cancer. Although significant progress has been made in the treatment of metastatic CRC, the 5-year survival remains &lt;12.5%, highlighting the urgent need for the development of new treatment approaches.Studies have shown that a high density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is correlated with better clinical outcome in patients with various cancers. These studies have also suggested that a high density of TILs is correlated with mutational load. One hypothesis in this context is that somatic mutations found in cancer cells may give rise to novel epitopes, so called neoepitopes, that attract and keep lymphocytes at the tumor site. It was also reported that cancers with a high mutational load respond best to checkpoint therapy, presumably due to neoepitopes  that can be targeted by T cells once they are released from inhibitory signals. One aim of this study was to analyze the correlation of the number of mutations and neoepitopes with lymphocyte infiltration at the invasive margin of CRC liver metastases, as this has not been systematically analyzed before. For this, we collected CRC liver metastases from a cohort of patients and selected 10 patients with high densities of infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL-high) and 10 patients with low densities (TIL-low). The two subgroups of samples were analyzed in a comparative manner for somatic mutations and neoepitopes."

EGAS00001002058,ptcv600e desmoplasia  complex microvolumes,"Although 60% of papillary thyroid carcinomas are BRAFV600E mutant (PTCV600E), the higher aggressiveness of these cancers is still debated. We analyzed 364 PTCs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), including 211 PTCV600E; stained 22 independent PTC for BRAFV600E and Ki67; sequenced the exomes and stained BRAFV600E in 5 primary tumor blocks and 4 nodal metastases from one PTCV600E patient; and reconstructed the 3D volumes of one tumor and one metastatic blocks at histological resolution. In TCGA BRAFV600E was associated with higher expression of proliferation markers and lower expression of thyroid differentiation markers, independently of tumor purity. Moreover, PTCV600E, in line with their overall lower purity, also had higher expression of fibroblast- and T-cell-associated genes, and presented more fibrosis. Tumor cells that appeared disconnected on 2D histological slices revealed to be part of a unique tumor component in the 3D reconstructed microvolumes, and formed a surprisingly complex connected space, infiltrating a proliferative stroma. Finally, in our PTC set, both stromal fibroblasts and tumor cells presented higher proliferation rates in PTCV600E. Our results support increased aggressiveness associated with BRAFV600E in PTC, and shed light on the important role of the stroma in tumor expansion. The concept of invasive front breaks down in the uncovered 3D morphology, as all tumor cells were within short distance or in contact with the stroma. The greater and more active fibrotic component could explain why BRAF inhibitors have proven less efficient in thyroid cancers and predict better efficiency of combined targeted treatments, as previously proposed for melanomaV600E."

Growing evidences suggest that single biopsies are inefficient for molecular profiling, due to clonal evolution and intratumoral heterogeneity of primary tumors and/or metastasis. Circulating free DNA (cfDNA) has emerged as an alternative source of genetic material that seems to be representative of the continuously changing tumor molecular features. Thus, the so-called 'liquid biopsy' also offers the additional advantages of accessibility and non-invasiveness for the patient. Novel strategies based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) of cfDNA are being currently developed, with most studies focusing on targeted deep sequencing panels of potential clinically actionable genes. Here we describe an alternative approach, consisting of exome-sequencing in cfDNA at a relatively shallower depth to provide a more general overview of the circulating genome. In this study, two groups of colorectal cancer patients, with either disseminated (M) or localized disease (N), were compared using whole-exome sequencing and a RNA-seq bioinformatics analysis pipeline. Thus, a set of 379 exons present at different levels in cfDNA from both groups were identified, giving rise to a completely new concept in this field, termed as 'Differential Presence of Exons'. Differentially present exons (DPEs) were subsequently used for M and N patients clustering and classification, allowing for the design of a predictive algorithm with encouraging preliminary results in a small subset of patients that could not be initially classified attending to the selection criteria (U group, unassignable)."

EGAS00001002531,germline polymorphisms direct  somatic architecture  prostate cancer,"NOT USED (moved to EGAS00001000900 )Germline polymorphisms are well-known to modulate cancer risk. Surprisingly, though, the influence of the germline on the molecular features that emerge in a tumour (germline-somatic interactions) is relatively understudied. Germline polymorphisms in BRCA2 are known to change the somatic aberration profile of tumours, but there has been no systematic study on interactions between the germline genome and somatic mutations. To fill this gap in knowledge, we quantified the influence of germline genetics on the somatic evolution of prostate cancer. We first demonstrate that two thirds of known risk SNPs influence somatic mutational profiles. We then discover 92 novel SNPs that exhibit germline-somatic mutational interactions, and validate a subset of these in an independent cohort. Using machine-learning approaches, we show that somatic aberrations in a prostate tumour can be predicted prior to diagnosis based on a man’s germline genetics – information present at birth. Taken together, these studies suggest germline factors play a large role in driving tumour evolution."

EGAS00001001290,targetted sequencing  208 cakut  genes,"New prioritization and burden analyses of rare variants in 208 candidate genes are questioning the pathogenicity of previously CAKUT-associated genetic variants  Background: The leading cause of end-stage renal disease in children is attributed to congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). Familial clustering and mouse models support the presence of monogenic causes. Genetic testing is insufficient as it mainly focuses on HNF1B and PAX2 mutations that are thought to explain CAKUT in 5-15% of patients.   Methods: To identify novel, potentially pathogenic variants in additional genes, we designed a panel of genes identified from studies on familial forms of isolated or syndromic CAKUT and genes suggested by in vitro and in vivo CAKUT models. The coding exons of 208 genes were analyzed in 453 patients with CAKUT using next-generation sequencing. Rare truncating, splice-site variants and non-synonymous variants, predicted to be deleterious and conserved, were prioritized as the most promising variants to have an effect on CAKUT.   Results: Previously reported disease-causing mutations were detected, but only five were fully penetrant causal mutations that improved diagnosis. We prioritized 148 candidate variants in 151 patients, found in 82 genes, for follow up studies. Using a burden test, we found no significant excess of rare variants in any of the genes in our cohort compared to controls.   Conclusions: Thus, in a study that represents the largest set of genes analyzed in CAKUT patients to date, the contribution of previously implicated genes to CAKUT risk is significantly smaller than expected and the disease may be more complex than previously assumed."

Additional risk factors remain to be identified, particularly in patients who develop HCC without cirrhosis. We identified clonal integration of adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) in 11 out of 193 HCC. These AAV2 integrations occurred within known cancer driver genes, namely, CCNA2 (Cyclin A2, 4 cases), TERT (Telomerase Reverse-Transcriptase, 1 case), CCNE1 (Cyclin E1, 3 cases), TNFSF10 (Tumor Necrosis Factor member 10, 2 cases) or KMT2B (Lysine (K)-Specific Methyltransferase 2B, 1 case) leading to over-expression of the target genes. Tumors with viral integration mainly developed in non-cirrhotic liver (9 out of 11 cases) and without known risk factors (6 out of 11) suggesting a pathogenic role of AAV2 in these patients. In conclusion, AAV2 is a DNA virus associated with oncogenic insertional mutagenesis in human HCC."

EGAS00001000039,methylation analysis  gm01240 gm01247,"Aim: We aim to compare current (MeDIP-seq), new (Illumina Infinium 450K BeadChip) and future (PacBio) methods for whole genome DNA methylation analysis. As the interest in determination of disease methylation profiles increases, the scope, advantages and limitations of these methods requires assessment. There are key questions to answer and specific challenges to overcome. For example, how much detail/resolution is sufficient to identify regions of differential methylation and regions of biological/medical significance within a sample? How much coverage of the genome is required for accurate methylation analysis? Is it important to confirm which regions of the genome are unmethylated in addition to focusing on those that are methylated? Loss of methylation may be of equal importance within the cell since this may also contribute to disease pathogenesis. A multi-method (affinity enrichment/bisulphite-conversion based/direct sequencing of methyl-cytosine) and technology platform (Illumina HiSeq/PacBio/Illumina Infinium BeadChip) comparison will enable us to determine the strengths and weakness of each method. We propose to compare four methods using two DNA samples from the Coriell Institute for Cell Repository to assess both current and future capabilities for whole genome methylation analysis in parallel: A) MeDIP-seq using Illumina HiSeq B) Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip and C) whole genome methylation sequencing using PacBio. Existing single molecule deep bisulphite sequencing data generated previously from these same samples at the WTSI for targeted regions (30-40 genes) on the human X chromosome will be used to assess performance of each method. The methods selected for this study will generate data covering a range of resolutions from a whole genome scan to array (target defined) resolution and up to single base pair, single molecule resolution; the highest level of detail possible with methods currently available.Samples: DNA from sibling pair GM01240 (female) and GM01240 (male).Requirements: Both samples will be analysed using;A.MeDIP-seq using Illumina HiSeq (one HiSeq lane, 75bp paired end, per sample)B.Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450K BeadChipWe are expecting a potentially unnecessary high coverage using one HiSeq lane per sample. However, for the MeDIP procedure we do not have a multiplexing procedure in place.

In order to apply this therapy to monogenic disorder, disease-causing mutations must be corrected prior to transplantation. We generated iPS cells from patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is caused by homozygous non-synonymous mutation in the SERPINA1 gene. In vitro differentiation of patient-derived iPS cells to hepatocytes showed recapitulation of the disease phenotype. We corrected the mutations by gene targeting using zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) and piggyBac transposon technologies. Our mutation correction is highly accurate. There is no exogenous sequence left behind at the targeted site. The corrected iPS cell-derived hepatocytes were indistinguishable from healthy hepatocyte, suggesting that the corrected gene was fully functional. The genomic integrity was also analyzed by CGH and SNP array, showing no genomic alterations. These are important points to ensure clinical safety as well as functional restoration of the corrected gene. One remaining question is if these corrected iPS cells are clinically safe at the single base-pair level. Recent publications suggested that cancer-related mutations are significantly accumulated during iPS cell propagation. We aim to assess the clinical safety of the corrected iPS cells by using exome sequencing. Outcome from this project would bring iPS cell technology one step closer to clinical applications."

Here, we apply scCOOL-seq (Chromatin Overall Omic-scale Landscape Sequencing) to generate a genome-wide map of DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution during human preimplantation development. Unlike in mice, the chromatin of paternal genome is already more open than that of maternal genome at the mid-zygote stage in humans, and this state is maintained until the 4-cell stage. After fertilization, genes with high variations in DNA methylation and those with high variations in chromatin accessibility tend to be two different sets. Furthermore, 1,797 (35%) out of 5,155 widely open chromatin regions in promoters closed when transcription activity was inhibited, indicating a feedback mechanism between transcription and open chromatin maintenance. Our work paves the way for dissecting the complex, yet highly coordinated, epigenetic reprogramming during human preimplantation development."
EGAS00001000072,extreme phenotypes exome sequencing  individuals hospitalised  severe influenza infection   mosaic  genisis studies,"Host genetics are important in severe infection phenotypes such as death or hospitalisation. In effect, extreme infection phenotypes can be considered similar to extreme drug reactions in that the majority of the population exhibits a 'typical' response, but a small subset can have an extreme response. In infection this extreme response can be either adverse pathology, outside the normal range or intrinsic resistant to infection. Whilst the later can be conferred by immune memory, in the case of new infections where pre-existing immunity does not exist then these 'resistant' individuals may have an underlying genetic protection. The intrinsically resistant and severe infection groups represent the extreme phenotypes of the infection spectrum. By combining a very high attack rate, a rare severe illness phenotype and an unchanged pathogen when comparing severe to community (uncomplicated) infection, the 2009-11 influenza outbreaks created an almost perfect situation for identifying genetic susceptibility markers to an emerging disease.

We have taken a lung cancer cell line H3122 (with the EML4-ALK rearrangement) and generated clones resistant to a small molecule inhibitor of ALK by serial exposure to the drug over 8 weeks. We now wish to characterise at the exome level whether the acquisiton of resistance has been accompanied by the development of new mutations that we can take forward for further study as the potential mechansims underlying the resistance.

A downstream validation study confirmed frequent inactivating mutations and/or protein deficiency of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex gene ARID1A in 83% of GCs with microsatellite instability, 73% of GCs with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, and 11% of non-EBV microsatellite stable GCs. The mutation spectrum of ARID1A differs between molecular subtypes and the mutation prevalence is negatively associated with mutations in TP53. Clinically, ARID1A alterations were associated with better prognosis in a stage-independent manner. These results revealed the genomic landscape and highlighted the importance of chromatin remodeling in the molecular taxonomy of GCs."

EGAS00001001679,genome diversity  africa project mali,"Globally, human populations show structured genetic diversity as a result of geographical dispersion, selection and drift. Understanding this genetic variation can provide insights into the evolutionary processes that shape both human adaptation and variation in disease. Populations from SSA have the highest levels of genetic diversity. This characteristic, in addition to historical genetic admixture, can lead to complexities in the design of studies assessing the genetic determinants of disease and human variation. However, such studies of African populations are also likely to provide new opportunities to discover novel disease susceptibility loci and variants and refine gene–disease association signals. A systematic assessment of genetic diversity within SSA would facilitate genomic epidemiological studies in the region.The Genome Diversity in Africa Project (GDAP) aims to produce a comprehensive catalogue of human genetic variation in SSA, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), structural variants, and haplotypes. This resource will make a substantial contribution to understanding patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations in SSA, as well as providing a global resource to help design, implement and interpret genomic studies in SSA populations and studies comprising globally diverse populations, complementing existing genomic resources. Specifically, we plan to carry out high depth whole genome sequencing of up to 2000 individuals across Africa (25 individuals from each ethnolinguistic group).Our scientific objectives are to: 1) develop a resource that provides a comprehensive catalogue of genetic variation in populations from SSA accessible to the global scientific community; 2) characterise population genetic diversity, structure, gene flow and admixture across SSA; 3) develop a cost-efficient, next-generation genotype array for diverse populations across SSA; and 4) facilitate whole genome-sequencing association studies of complex traits and diseases by developing a reference panel for imputation and resource for enhancing fine-mapping disease susceptibility loci.

EGAS00001001341,genome wide association studies identify genetic loci  low von willebrand factor levels,"Background. von Willebrand Factor (VWF) levels are highly variable and are largely determined by genetic factors. Low VWF levels are associated with bleeding symptoms and are a diagnostic criterion for von Willebrand Disease, the most common inherited bleeding disorder. To date, it is unknown which genetic loci besides morbific variation in VWF, are associated with reduced VWF levels. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies to identify genetic loci associated with low VWF levels.  Methods and results. For this meta-analysis we included 31,149 participants of European ancestry from eleven community-based studies. From all participants VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) measurements and genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) scans were available. Each study conducted analyses of all directly genotyped and imputed SNPs using logistic regression on dichotomized VWF:Ag measures (lowest 5% for blood group O and non-O) with an additive genetic model adjusted for age and sex. An inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis was performed for VWF:Ag levels and summary p-values and β-coefficients were calculated.  A total of 86 SNPs exceeded the genome-wide significance threshold of 510-8 and comprised five loci on four different chromosomes: 6q24 (smallest p-value 8.810-10), 9q34 (2.110-60), 12p13 (8.310-22), 12q23 (4.310-8), 13q13 (2.610-8). All loci were within or close to genes, including STXBP5 (6q24), STAB5 (12q23), ABO (9q34), VWF (12p13), and UFM1 (13q13).  Conclusions. In addition to ABO blood group and VWF, three other genetic loci (STXBP5, STAB2, and UFM1) are associated with low VWF levels. These findings point to novel mechanisms for the occurrence of low VWF levels."

It has been apparent for many years that CVID has a genetic component, occurs frequently in families and can have both a recessive or dominant mode of inheritance. In recent years, 4 genes underlying CVID have been identified; however, mutations within in them are estimated to account for no more than 10% of all cases of CVID.We have identified a multi-generational family with autosomal dominant CVID. Genome-wide linkage analysis has mapped the locus underlying CVID in this family to an approximately 9.2 Mb interval on chromosome 3q27.3-q29, between the markers D3S3570 and D3S1265. This locus is distinct from any of the previously mapped susceptibility loci suggesting a novel genetic variant is responsible for disease in this family. The aim of this study is to use exome sequencing of affected (n = 4) and unaffected (n = 4) individuals, in tandem with the available genetic mapping data, to identify the causal variant underlying CVID in this family."

EGAS00001000292,molecular characterization  invasive lobular carcinoma,"Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most common histological subtype of breast cancer accounting for 10-15% of cases. ILC differs from invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)with respect to epidemiology, histology, and clinical presentation. Moreover, ILC is lesssensitive to chemotherapy, more frequently bilateral, and more prone to form gastrointestinal, peritoneal, and ovarian metastases than IDCs. In contrast to IDC, the prognostic value ofhistological grade (HG) in ILC is controversial. One of the three major components of histological grading (tubule formation) is missing in ILC which hinders the process of gradingin this histological subtype and results in the classification of approximately two thirds of ILC as HG 2.Over the last decade, a number of gene expression signatures have shed light onto breast cancer classification, allowing breast cancer care to become more personalized. Withrespect to the management of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, several gene expression signatures provide prognostic and/or predictive information beyond what is possible with current classical clinico-pathological parameters alone. Nevertheless, most studies using gene expression signature have not considered different histologic subtypesseparately. Recently, a comprehensive research program has elucidated some of the biological underpinnings of invasive lobular carcinoma. Genetic material extracted from 200 ILC tumor samples were studied using gene expression profiling and identified ILCmolecular subtypes. These proliferation-driven gene signatures of ILC appear to have prognostic significance. In particular, the Genomic Grade (GG) gene signature improved upon HG in ILC and added prognostic value to classic clinico-pathologic factors. In addition this study demonstrated that most ILC are molecularly characterized as luminal-A (~75%)followed by luminal-B (~20%) and HER2-positve tumors (~5%). Moreover, we investigated the prognostic value of known gene signatures/ gene modules in the same cohort of ILC. As a second step within the scope of this project, we aim to investigate the interactionsbetween somatic ILC tumor mutations to observed transcriptome findings. To this end, we aim to perform somatic mutation analysis for the ILC tumors for which Affymetrix gene expression profiling is available. To this end, we will use a gene screen assay, which specifically interrogates the mutational status of a few hundreds of cancer genes. We believe that this pioneering effort will be fundamental for a tailored treatment of ILC withimprovement in patients' outcome."

EGAS00001000305,p647 targeted resequencing project,"In collaboration with Dr Robert Semple we have identified a family harbouring an autosomal dominant variant, which leads to severe insulin resistance (SIR), short stature and facial dysmorphism. This family is unique within the SIR cohort in having normal lipid profiles, preserved adiponectin and normal INSR expression and phosphorylation. DNA is available for 7 affected and 7 unaffected family members across 3 generations. All 14 samples have been genotyped using microsatellites and the Affymetrix 6.0 SNP chip. Linkage analysis identified an 18.8Mb haplotype on chromosome 19 as a possible location of the causative variant. However, Exome sequencing of 3 affected and 1 unaffected family members has not identified the causative variant suggesting the possibility of an intronic or intergenic variant in this region or elsewhere in the genome. We propose to conduct whole genome sequencing of 5 members of the pedigree at a depth of 20X. The chosen samples are two sets of parents plus one member of an unaffected branch of the pedigree who shares the risk haplotype on chromosome 19. Sequencing of the two sets of parents will be used along with the genome-wide SNP data to impute 4 affected children giving an effect sample size of 6 affected individuals."

Our studies will focus primarily on cardiovascular-related quantitative traits, obesity and related metabolic traits, neurodevelopmental disorders and a limited number of extreme clinical phenotypes that will provide proof-of-concept for future familial trait sequencing. We will analyse directly quantitative traits in the cohorts and the selected traits in the extreme samples, and also use imputation down to 0.1% allele frequency to extend the analyses to further sample sets with genome wide genotype data. In each case we will investigate indels and larger structural variants as well as SNPs, and use statistical methods that combine rare variants in a locus or pathway as well as single-variant approaches.

Precision oncology aims to apply optimal therapies for each tumor based on its molecular characteristics. We have established a resource reporting the genomic and transcriptomic profiles of 462 patient tumor-derived cells (PDCs) across 14 cancer types, together with responses to 60 targeted agents. Compared with long-term cultured cancer cell lines, PDCs better recapitulate the molecular profiles of the original tumors. Among other unreported associations, we identify molecular factors inducing resistance to EGFR inhibitors in glioblastoma, and we suggest repurposing ibrutinib (currently used in hematological malignancies) for EGFR-specific therapy in gliomas.

To determine the genetic basis for neuroblastoma we performed whole-genome sequencing (6 cases), exome sequencing (16 cases), genome-wide rearrangement analyses (32 cases), and targeted analyses of specific genomic loci (40 cases) using massively parallel sequencing.    On average each tumor had 19 somatic alterations in coding genes (range, 3-70).  Among genes not previously known to be involved in neuroblastoma, chromosomal deletions and sequence alterations of chromatin remodeling genes, ARID1A and ARID1B, were identified in 8 of 71 tumors (11%) and were associated with early treatment failure and decreased survival.  Using tumor-specific structural alterations, we developed an approach to identify rearranged DNA fragments in sera, providing personalized biomarkers for minimal residual disease detection and monitoring.

Remarkable age-related differences in structural rearrangement (SR) formation became evident, suggesting distinct disease pathomechanisms. Whereas EO-PCAs harbored a prevalence of balanced SRs, with a specific abundance of androgen-regulated ETS gene fusions including TMPRSS2:ERG, elderly-onset PCAs displayed primarily non-androgen-associated SRs. Data from a validation cohort of &gt;10,000 patients showed age-dependent androgen receptor levels and a prevalence of SRs affecting androgen-regulated genes, further substantiating the activity of a characteristic ""androgen-type"" pathomechanism in EO-PCA."

About 5% of colorectal adenomas are estimated to progress to CRC. However, it is important to identify which adenomas actually are at high-risk of progression, because these should serve as intermediate endpoints for e.g. CRC screening programs. In clinical practice, adenomas with a size of ≥10 mm, villous component and/or high-grade dysplasia, called advanced adenomas, are considered high-risk, although this classification lacks solid evidence. Specific DNA copy number changes are associated with adenoma-to-carcinoma progression.For this tissue dataset, we applied low-pass whole genome sequencing to 98 non-advanced and advanced adenomas.

Transcriptional silencing driven by CpG methylation converges exclusively on targets of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 which represses expression of differentiation genes through trimethylation of H3K27. CpG island methylator phenotype-positive hindbrain ependymomas are responsive to clinical drugs that target either DNA or H3K27 methylation both in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that epigenetic modifiers are the first rational therapeutic candidates for this deadly malignancy, which is epigenetically deregulated but genetically bland."

Here, we discovered recurrent somatic coding sequence mutations of the tyrosine phosphatase gene PTPN1 in the tumor genomes and transcriptomes of these B cell lymphomas (6 of 30 or in 20% of HL cases and 13 of 49 or in 27% of PMBCL cases), consisting of nonsense, missense and frameshift mutations. We demonstrate that PTPN1 mutations lead to reduced phosphatase activity and increased phosphorylation of JAK-STAT pathway members. Moreover, silencing of PTPN1 by RNA interference in HL cell line KM-H2 resulted in hyperphosphorylation and overexpression of downstream oncogenic targets. Our data establish PTPN1 mutations as novel drivers in B cell lymphomagenesis."

EGAS00001000579,mutational analysis reveals  origin  therapy driven evolution  recurrent glioma,"Tumor recurrence is a leading cause of cancer mortality. Therapies for recurrent disease may fail, at least in part, because the genomic alterations driving the growth of recurrences are distinct from those in the initial tumor. To explore this hypothesis, we sequenced the exomes of 23 initial low-grade gliomas and recurrent tumors resected from the same patients. In 43% of cases, at least half of the mutations in the initial tumor were undetected at recurrence, including driver mutations inTP53, ATRX, SMARCA4, and BRAF; this suggests that recurrent tumors are often seeded by cells derived from the initial tumor at a very early stage of their evolution. Notably, tumors from 6 of 10 patients treated with the chemotherapeutic drug temozolomide (TMZ) followed an alternative evolutionary path to high-grade glioma. At recurrence, these tumors were hypermutated and harbored driver mutations in the RB (retinoblastoma) and Akt-mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathways that bore the signature of TMZ-induced mutagenesis."

DIPG are highly infiltrative malignant glial neoplasms of the ventral pons, which due to their location within the brain, make them unsuitable for surgical resection and consequently have a universally dismal clinical outcome. Recent high-throughput sequencing approaches have revealed a striking prevalence of K27M mutations in the genes encoding the histone variants H3.3 (H3F3A) or H3.1 (HIST1H3B) in the childhood brain tumour DIPG2. This K-to-M substitution confers a trans-dominant ablation of global H3K27 trimethylation, which likely profoundly alters gene expression through de-repression of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) target genes. Despite these advances in our understanding of the distinct biology of these tumours, approaches for specific novel therapeutic interventions are not clear, and little has been reported of the secondary mutations accompanying these changes. We carried out whole genome sequencing (EGAS00001000524) on a series of 20 pre-treatment biopsy samples of DIPG, for which the patients underwent a safe stereotactic procedure, and whole exome sequencing (EGAS00001000572) on a further six samples obtained at autopsy."

EGAS00001002381,human pscs derived bat rnaseq analysis,"Obesity and associated metabolic complications are major health problems. Here we propose a strategy focused on targeting the mechanisms controlling energy dissipation to create negative energy balance. The brown adipose tissue (BAT) is specialised in energy dissipation in response to environmental stimuli such as cold and increased lipid rich hypercaloric intake, a process referred as adaptive thermogenesis. This energy dissipating role of BAT is mediated by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). The relevance of BAT activation to energy balance is well established in murine models. The realisation that functional BAT is also found in adult humans is much more recent. An inverse relationship between adiposity, diabetes and BAT activity has been observed. These results support the concept that increasing a) BAT mass, b) activity o c) recruitment of beige cells could be a safe and efficient strategy to prevent or treat obesity and its associated complications. Current cellular and developmental models of adipogenesis have limited therapeutic potential and constrains the discovery of cell fate mechanisms involved in human BAT development. To surmount these issues, human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in vitro differentiation represents a promising complementary model of brown adipogenesis.
Within the pump-priming project “ES/IPS cells differentiation to brown/beige adipocytes as an anti-obesity strategy”, we developed a model of human PSC-derived brown adipose tissue progenitors (mesodermal, early, late progenitors) and of mature brown adipocyte.

We show that Gleason 7 cancer is highly heterogeneous at the SNV, CNV, and intra-chromosomal translocation levels, and is characterized by a very low number of recurrent SNVs but significant structural variation. We identified a novel recurrent MYCL1 amplification, which was strongly associated with TP53 deletion and prognostic for biochemical recurrence in this cohort. Moreover, we identified clear evidence of divergent tumour evolution in multi focal cancer and, in 2/5 cases evaluated, multiple tumours of independent clonal origin. Taken together, these data represent the first systematic evaluation of the differential genomics of potentially curable prostate cancer, and strongly suggest that a more robust understanding of the relationship between genetic heterogeneity and clinical outcomes is required to effectively develop biomarkers of prognosis based on tumour genomics."
EGAS00001000556, genome sequencing  autism spectrum disorder,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) demonstrates high heritability and familial clustering, yet the genetic causes remain only partially understood as a result of extensive clinical and genomic heterogeneity. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) shows promise as a tool for identifying ASD risk genes as well as unreported mutations in known loci, but an assessment of its full utility in an ASD group has not been performed. We used WGS to examine 32 families with ASD to detect de novo or rare inherited genetic variants predicted to be deleterious (loss-of-function and damaging missense mutations). Among ASD probands, we identified deleterious de novo mutations in six of 32 (19%) families and X-linked or autosomal inherited alterations in ten of 32 (31%) families (some had combinations of mutations). The proportion of families identified with such putative mutations was larger than has been previously reported; this yield was in part due to the comprehensive and uniform coverage afforded by WGS. Deleterious variants were found in four unrecognized, nine known, and eight candidate ASD risk genes. Examples include CAPRIN1 and AFF2 (both linked to FMR1, which is involved in fragile X syndrome), VIP (involved in social-cognitive deficits), and other genes such as SCN2A and KCNQ2 (linked to epilepsy), NRXN1, and CHD7, which causes ASD-associated CHARGE syndrome. Taken together, these results suggest that WGS and thorough bioinformatic analyses for de novo and rare inherited mutations will improve the detection of genetic variants likely to be associated with ASD or its accompanying clinical symptoms."

Genomewide significant association of podoconiosis with rs17612858, located 5.7kb from HLA-DQA1 (OR=2.44, 95% CI = 1.82-3.26, P =1.42 x 10-9 in the allelic model), and suggestive associations (P&lt;1.0x10-5) with 7 SNPs in or near HLA-DQB1, HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DRB1 were found. These associations were confirmed using family-based association testing. HLA analysis showed HLA-DRB1*0701 (OR =2.0), DQA1*0201 (OR=1.91) and DQB1*0202 (OR=1.79) alleles and the DRB1*0701-DQB1*0202 haplotype (OR=1.92) were risk variants for podoconiosis.Proposed workWe are seeking funding from the MRC to:i) extend the podoconiosis bioresource to include a further 600 samples from the GWAS population in southern Ethiopia, 1600 samples from 2 ethnically distinct Ethiopian populations in Ethiopia and 800 samples from Cameroonii) confirm associations identified in the initial GWAS by typing associated SNPs in each of these populations;iii) perform high resolution HLA Class II typing of cases, family members and controls;iv) sequence 200 whole exomesv) fine map the region using these population-specific variants to identify putative causal variants.We plan to carry out the experiments for ii. and iv. at the Sanger."
EGAS00001000581,blueprint human variation project  genome sequencing,"The BLUEPRINT project is a large-scale project investigating epigenetic mechanisms involved in blood formation, in health and disease. The  human variation workpackage (WP10, led by NS) of the project seeks to characterize the effect of common sequence variation on the epigenome status of a cell. To do this, the project will use highly purified blood cells to minimise “experimental noise” and therefore enhance the power to discover modest effects.  Two peripheral blood cell types, the CD14+CD16- monocyte (an important central orchestrator of adaptive immunity and a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity) and the CD65+CD9- neutrophilic granulocyte (the frontline cell for innate immunity) have been selected for this purpose.  The two types of cells will be obtained at high purity from adult blood (AB) of 200 healthy males and females, respectively.  Cells will be purified by using already validated and fully operational protocols that are based on density gradient centrifugation of the buffy coat obtained from whole blood, followed by magnetic bead-based purification using monoclonal antibodies against Cluster of Differentiation (CD) lineage-specific cell surface markers.  Units of 475 ml of AB will be obtained from consenting volunteers of the Cambridge BioResource (CBR), a panel of 10,000 healthy volunteers local to Cambridge who have already consented to participate in biomedical research and of whom biological samples (DNA, plasma, serum) and lifestyle data have been deposited in a repository and database, respectively.   Nuclei, DNA and RNA will be recovered from the purified cells and made available for RNA-seq, DNA-seq and ChIP-seq and genomic DNA for entire genome sequencing will be recovered from the DNA repository. This dataset contains the whole-genome sequence of the 200 CBR volunteers at low pass (6x coverage)."

Marked differences in the pattern of genomic alterations existed between and within histological subtypes, thus challenging the original histomorphological diagnosis. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed many of these reassigned subtypes. The reassignment eliminated almost all cases of large cell carcinomas, some of which had therapeutically relevant alterations. Prospective testing of our genomics-based diagnostic algorithm in 5145 lung cancer patients enabled a genome-based diagnosis in 3863 (75%) patients, confirmed the feasibility of rational reassignments of large cell lung cancer, and led to improvement in overall survival in patients with EGFR-mutant or ALK-rearranged cancers.

EGAS00001000652,microsatellite data   demographic expansions  sedentary    nomadic human populations  africa  eurasia,"The transition from hunting and gathering to plant and animal domestication was one of the most important cultural and technological revolutions in human history. According to archeologists and paleoanthropologists, this transition triggered major demographic expansions. However, few genetic studies have found traces of Neolithic expansions in the current repartition of genetic polymorphism, pointing rather toward Paleolithic expansions. Here, we used microsatellite autosomal data to investigate the past demographic history of 87 African and Eurasian human populations with contrasted lifestyles (nomadic hunter-gatherers, semi-nomadic herders and sedentary farmers). Likely due to the combination of a higher mutation rate and the possibility to analyze several loci as independent replicates of the coalescent process, the analysis of microsatellite data allowed us to infer more recent expansions than previous genetic studies, potentially resulting from the Neolithic transition. Despite the variability in their location and environment, we found consistent expansions for all sedentary farmers, while we inferred constant population sizes for all hunter-gatherers and most herders, which could result from constraints linked to a nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyle and/or competition for land between herders and farmers. As an exception, we inferred expansions for Central Asian herders. This might be linked with the arid environment of this area, which may have been more favorable to nomadic herders than to sedentary farmers. Alternatively, current Central Asian herders may descent from populations who have first experienced a transition from hunter-gathering to sedentary agropastoralism, and then a second transition to nomadic herding."

EGAS00001003121,resolving  full spectrum  human genome variation  linked reads,"Large-scale population based analyses coupled with advances in technology have demonstrated that the human genome is more diverse than originally thought. Standard short-read approaches, used primarily due to accuracy, throughput and costs, fail to give a complete picture of a genome. They struggle to identify large, balanced structural events, cannot access repetitive regions of the genome and fail to resolve the human genome into its two haplotypes. Here we describe an approach that retains long range information while harnessing the power of short reads. Starting from only 1ng of DNA, we produce barcoded short read libraries. The use of novel informatic approaches allows for the barcoded short reads to be associated with the long molecules of origin producing a novel datatype known as 'Linked-Reads'. This approach allows for simultaneous detection of small and large variants from a single Linked-Read library. We have previously demonstrated the utility of whole genome Linked-Reads (lrWGS) for performing diploid, de novo assembly of individual genomes. In this manuscript, we show the utility of reference based analysis using a single Linked-Read library for full spectrum genome analysis. We demonstrate the ability of Linked-Reads to reconstruct megabase scale haplotypes and to recover parts of the genome that are typically inaccessible to short reads, including phenotypically important genes such as STRC, SMN1 and SMN2. We demonstrate the ability of both lrWGS and Linked-Read Whole Exome Sequencing (lrWES) to identify complex structural variations, including balanced events, single exon deletions, and single exon duplications. The data presented here show that Linked-Reads provide a scalable approach for comprehensive genome analysis that is not possible using short reads alone."

AML with inv(3)/t(3;3) is associated with aberrant expression of the stem-cell regulator EVI1. Applying functional genomics and genome-engineering, we demonstrate that both 3q-rearrangements reposition a distal GATA2 enhancer to ectopically activate EVI1 and simultaneously confer GATA2 functional haploinsufficiency, previously identified as the cause of sporadic familial AML/MDS and MonoMac/Emberger syndromes. Genomic excision of the ectopic enhancer restored EVI1 silencing and led to growth inhibition and differentiation of AML cells, which could be replicated by pharmacologic BET-inhibition. Our data show that structural rearrangements involving chromosomal repositioning of enhancers can cause deregulation of two unrelated distal genes, with cancer as the outcome."

This ALL subtype is associated with an overall favorable prognosis, nevertheless 10-20% of children will suffer from relapse. ETV6/RUNX1-positive preleukemic clones arise already in utero, but require additional cooperating oncogenic lesions for the development of overt leukemia. The aim of the study was to identify assisting genetic alterations and to provide closer insights into the mechanisms driving the development of leukemia and recurrent disease. To this end, whole genome and whole exome sequencing was applied to comprehensively analyze the assisting oncogenic alterations in pediatric patients with initial and/or recurrent ETV6/RUNX1+ ALL (primary disease n=11, recurrent disease m=7). Matched sample sets taken at initial diagnosis, remission and relapse were compared.

EGAS00001000685,recurrent epimutations activate gene body promoters  primary glioblastoma,"Aberrant DNA hypomethylation may play an important role in the growth rate of glioblastoma (GBM), but the functional impact on transcription remains poorly understood. We assayed the GBM methylome with MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq, adjusting for copy number differences, in a small set of non-glioma CpG island methylator phenotype (non-G-CIMP) primary tumors. Recurrent hypomethylated loci were enriched within a region of chromosome 5p15 that is specified as a cancer amplicon and also encompasses TERT, encoding telomerase reverse transcriptase, which plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. Overall, 76 gene body promoters were recurrently hypomethylated, including TERT and the oncogenes GLI3 and TP73. Recurring hypomethylation also affected previously unannotated alternative promoters, and luciferase reporter assays for three of four of these promoters confirmed strong promoter activity in GBM cells. Histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) ChIP-seq on tissue from the GBMs uncovered peaks that coincide precisely with tumor-specific decrease of DNA methylation at 200 loci, 133 of which are in gene bodies. Detailed investigation of TP73 and TERT gene body hypomethylation demonstrated increased expression of corresponding alternate transcripts, which in TP73 encodes a truncated p73 protein with oncogenic function and in TERT encodes a putative reverse transcriptase-null protein. Our findings suggest that recurring gene body promoter hypomethylation events, along with histone H3K4 trimethylation, alter the transcriptional landscape of GBM through the activation of a limited number of normally silenced promoters within gene bodies, in at least one case leading to expression of an oncogenic protein."

EGAS00001002587,itcc pediatric preclinical poc platform itcc p4,"Cancer remains the leading cause of disease-related death in children. For the ~25% of children who experience relapses of their malignant solid tumors, usually after very intensive first-line therapy, curative treatment options are scarce. Preclinical drug testing to identify promising treatment options that match the molecular make-up of the tumor is hampered by the fact that i) molecular genetic data on pediatric solid tumors from relapsed patients and thus our understanding of tumor evolution and therapy resistance are very limited to date and ii) for many of the high-risk entities, no appropriate and molecularly well characterized patient-derived models and/or genetic mouse models are currently available. Thus, quality-assured upfront preclinical testing of novel molecularly targeted compounds in a (saturated) repertoire of well-characterized models will establish the basis to increase therapeutic successes of these drugs in children with solid malignancies. Since these tumors are overall genetically much less complex than their adult counterparts, it is anticipated that it will be easier to identify powerful predictive biomarkers to allow for accurate matching of targets and drugs.To address this high but as yet unmet clinical need, the main objectives for this preclinical platform project are the following:• To establish a representative collection of patient-derived in vitro and in vivo models (target: n=400) as well as genetic mouse models (target: maximum of 15 spread out across multiple tumor types) of the most common pediatric solid high-risk entities including a significant proportion of models from relapses.• To molecularly characterize and to quality-assess the models as well as the matching primary tumor samples and germline controls with state-of-the-art molecular diagnostic tools.• To enable regulatory filings in the EU through the development of comprehensive preclinical data packages necessary to move drugs into clinical trials for children with solid tumors.• To prioritize pediatric drug development using existing collections of molecular data for systematic target reports, followed by in vivo drug testing in faithful disease models including pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamicswhere necessary (e.g., brain penetration). In vivo drug testing will also include at least three standard-of care-drugs for all models as a baseline for comparisons.• To identify suitable biomarkers for future clinical stratification of patients across entities.• Ultimately, the establishment of the ITCC-P4 platform over the long term will overcome a long-standing gap by enabling thorough molecular characterization of high-risk pediatric malignancies coupled with standardized preclinical testing procedures, and will thus greatly expedite the development of more precise and efficacious drugs for this patient group. Developing this platform as a public-private partnership will create a model for collaboration that can hopefully be extended to other types of cancer entities and patient groups."

In this study we describe the conversion of NK cells (CD49a-CD49b+Eomes+) into intermediate type 1 innate lymphoid (intILC1) cell (CD49a+CD49b+Eomes+) and ILC1 (CD49a+CD49b-Eomes-) cell populations in the tumor microenvironment dependent on TGF-β signaling. Strikingly, intILC1s/ILC1s were unable to control local tumor growth and metastasis, whereas NK cells favored tumor immune surveillance. Experiments using TNF-blocking antibodies suggested that innate immune escape was partially mediated by TNF-producing ILC1s. Together our data highlight the unexpected plasticity of group 1 ILCs in tumors and reveal a novel mechanism by which tumors escape innate immune surveillance."

We sequenced the exomes of six individuals from three SCCOHT families. After discovering segregating deleterious germline mutations in SMARCA4 in all three families, we tested DNA from a fourth family, which also possessed a segregating SMARCA4 germline mutation. All familial tumors sequenced harboured either a somatic mutation or loss of the wild-type allele. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of these and additional familial and non-familial cases showed loss of the SMARCA4 protein (BRG1) in 38/40 tumors overall. Sequencing of cases with available DNA revealed at least one germline or somatic deleterious SMARCA4 mutation in 30/32 cases. Additionally, the SCCOHT cell line BIN-67 contained bi-allelic deleterious mutations in SMARCA4. Our findings identify alterations in SMARCA4 as the major cause of SCCOHT, which could lead to genetic counseling and new treatment approaches."

The aim of the present project is to identify the catalog of somatic and germline mutations in liver tumors using whole genome and whole exome sequencing together with CGH-SNP, methylome and transcriptomic profiling. For this purpose, a series of 500 liver tumors are collected through the French National Liver Collection and these samples will be analyzed using the different omics technologies. The data will be deposited in the ICGC and EGA database to be publically available for the scientific community.  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for more than 90% of liver cancers, and is a major health problem. It is the 3rd cause of cancer-related mortality. Advances in genomic analyses have formed a comprehensive understanding of different underlying pathobiological layers resulting in hepatocarcinogenesis. Thus, the development of next-generation sequencing technologies has made it possible to generate more comprehensive catalogues of somatic alteration events (single nucleotide substitutions, structural variations, and epigenetic changes) in liver cancer genome than ever before.

Here we show that patient-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MDS MSCs) display a disturbed differentiation program and are essential for the propagation of MDS-initiating lin-CD34+CD38- stem cells in orthotopic xenografts. Overproduction of niche factors such as N-Cadherin, IGFBP2, VEGFA and LIF is associated with the ability of MDS MSCs to enhance MDS expansion. These factors represent putative therapeutic targets to disrupt critical hematopoietic-stromal interactions in MDS. Finally, healthy MSCs adopt ""MDS-MSC like"" molecular features when exposed to hematopoietic MDS cells, indicative of an instructive remodeling of their microenvironment. This patient-derived xenograft model therefore provides functional and molecular evidence that MDS is a complex disease involving both the hematopoietic and stromal compartments. The resulting deregulated expression of niche factors may well also be a feature of other hematopoietic malignancies."

However a comprehensive comparative study of the characteristics of these hiPSCs has been missing from the literature. Importantly studies which aimed to address these aspects of hiPSCs have used cells from different patients.

We mapped the acquired genomic alterations in human and mouse HCCs induced by defects in hepatocyte biliary transporters, which expose hepatocytes to bile salts and cause the onset of chronic inflammation that develops into cancer. In both human and mouse cancer genomes we found few somatic point mutations with no impairment of cancer genes, but instead massive gene amplification and rearrangements. This genomic landscape differs greatly from that of virus- and alcohol-associated liver cancer. Copy number gains preferentially occurred at late stages of cancer development and frequently targeted the MAPK signaling pathway, and in particular direct regulators of JNK. The pharmacological inhibition of JNK retarded cancer progression in the mouse. Our study demonstrates that intrahepatic cholestasis leading to hepatocyte exposure to bile acids and inflammation promotes cancer through genomic modifications that can be clearly distinguished from those determined by other etiological factors."

Novel and targetable mutations are needed for improved understanding and treatment of lung cancer in never-smokers. Methods. Twenty-seven lung adenocarcinomas from never-smokers were sequenced by both exome and mRNA-seq with respective normal tissues. Somatic mutations were detected and compared with pathway deregulation, tumor phenotypes and clinical outcomes. Results. Although somatic mutations in DNA or mRNA ranged from hundreds to thousands in each tumor, the overlap mutations between the two were only a few to a couple of hundreds. The number of somatic mutations from either DNA or mRNA was not significantly associated with clinical variables; however, the number of overlap mutations was associated with cancer subtype. The overlap mutations were preferentially expressed in mRNA. Ten genes (EGFR, TP53, KRAS, RPS6KB2, ATXN2, DHX9, PTPN13, SP1, SPTAN1 and MYOF) had recurrent mutations and these mutations were highly correlated with pathway deregulation and patient survival. Conclusions. The conserved recurrent mutations in RNAs are likely the driver for tumor biology, pathway deregulation and clinical outcomes.

We performed multi-region sequencing of early-stage NSCLCs. Spatial dissection revealed branched tumor evolution, with driver mutations occurring before and after subclonal diversification. Intra-tumor heterogeneity in DNA copy number alterations, translocations and endogenous APOBEC mutational processes demonstrates that NSCLC may follow multiple distinct evolutionary trajectories simultaneously. In smokers, despite maintained carcinogen exposure, temporal dissection reveals a relative decrease in smoking-related mutations during tumor progression, accompanied by an increase in APOBEC-related mutations. In the tumors from ex-smokers, genome-doubling occurred before subclonal diversification, suggesting prolonged latency before clinical detection. Multi-region sequencing demonstrates the relentless and heterogeneous nature of genomic instability processes in early-stage NSCLCs."

A detailed understanding of the biology and genetics of CRC is a prerequisite for precision medicine. To address this challenge in clinical oncology, the OncoTrack consortium recruited 106 CRC patients (stages I-IV) and developed an integrated pre-clinical platform analysing drug sensitivity in the established matched patient-derived in vivo and in vitro models, 46 three-dimensional cell cultures and 59 xenografts, recapitulating many of the molecular features of the donor tumours. We generated extensive omics information on patient tumours and their derived models used to generate a compendium of drug sensitivity data. We could distinguish tumour molecular sub-groups responding differently to therapy and identified a novel independent predictor of sensitivity to the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab. The findings reported here will advance our understanding of CRC and its response to therapy."

EGAS00001001165,genesis    prevalent variants causing combined pituitary hormone deficiency  21 populations,"Two variants (c.[301_302delAG];[301_302delAG] and c.[150delA];[150delA]) in the PROP1 gene are the most common genetic causes of recessively inherited combined pituitary hormones deficiency (CPHD). Our objective was to analyze in detail the origin of the two most prevalent variants. In the multicentric study were included 237 patients with CPHD and their 15 relatives carrying c.[301_302delAG];[301_302delAG] or c.[150delA];[150delA] or c.[301_302delAG];[ 150delA]. They originated from 21 different countries worldwide. We genotyped 21 single nucleotide variant markers flanking the 9.6Mb region around the PROP1 gene that are not in mutual linkage disequilibrium in the general populations - a finding of a common haplotype would be indicative of ancestral origin of the variant. Haplotypes were reconstructed by Phase and Haploview software, and the variant age was estimated using an allelic association method. We demonstrated ancestral origin of both variants: c.[301_302delAG] was carried on 0.2Mb-long haplotype in a majority of European patients arising approximately 101 generations ago (confidence interval 90.1-116.4). Patients from the Iberian Peninsula displayed a different haplotype which was estimated to have emerged 23.3 (20.1-29.1) generations ago. Subsequently, the data indicated that both haplotypes were transmitted to Latin American patients approximately 13.8 (12.2-17.0) and 16.4 (14.4-20.1) generations ago, respectively. The c.[150delA] variant that was carried on a haplotype spanning about 0.3Mb was estimated to appear 43.7 (38.4-52.7) generations ago. We present strong evidence that the most frequent variants in the PROP1 gene are not a consequence of variant hot-spots as previously assumed, but are founder variants."

EGAS00001001242, transcription factor gabp selectively binds  activates  mutant tert promoter  cancer,"Reactivation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression enables cells to overcome replicative senescence and escape apoptosis, fundamental steps in the initiation of human cancer.  Multiple cancer types, including up to 83% of glioblastomas (GBM), harbor highly recurrent TERT promoter mutations of unknown function but specific to two nucleotide positions. We identify the functional consequence of these mutations in GBM to be recruitment of the multimeric GABP transcription factor specifically to the mutant promoter. Allelic recruitment of GABP is consistently observed across four cancer types, highlighting a shared mechanism underlying TERT reactivation. Tandem flanking native ETS motifs critically cooperate with these mutations to activate TERT, likely by facilitating GABP heterotetramer binding. GABP thus directly links TERT promoter mutations to aberrant expression in multiple cancers."

EGAS00001001244,intra tumor heterogeneity  clonal evolution patterns  platinum resistant high grade serous ovarian cancer,"Although many high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) patients are initially sensitive to the standard-of-care platinum-based therapy, intra-tumor heterogeneity may fuel selection towards platinum-resistant clones over subsequent lines of therapy. We performed whole-exome coupled to ultra-deep re-sequencing and copy number alteration (CNA) profiling on 31 matched diagnosis and relapse tumors from HGSOC patients treated with platinum. Genetic heterogeneity within tumor pairs varied extremely, with some recurrent tumors being identical and others completely different from the primary tumor. All primary tumors showed evidence of homologous recombination (HR)-deficiency, but none of them carried reactivating mutations in the HR pathway at relapse, also not when becoming resistant to subsequent lines of platinum. We did also not identify other mutations, CNAs or pathways that were enriched in platinum-resistant clones. However, a platinum score consisting of 13 CNAs correlated significantly with platinum-free interval (PFI) after first-line therapy in multiple cohorts of &gt;450 primary HGSOCs. A relative increase of this score in the relapsed tumor correlated with a change in PFI during subsequent therapy. Clonal evolution under platinum therapy contributes to genetic heterogeneity within tumor pairs, implicating that genetic tests linked to targeted treatment options for recurrent HGSOC need to be performed on biopsies collected at relapse. Platinum resistance of an initially platinum-sensitive HR-deficient HGSOC at relapse is not caused by reactivation of the HR pathway, suggesting that these tumors are still responsive to PARP inhibitors, instead, several chromosomal aberrations contribute to a score predictive of disease outcome under platinum therapy, both in first and subsequent lines of platinum therapy."

We exome sequenced 40 tumor regions from 8 patients with operable EACs both before and after platinum-containing NAC. This revealed the evolutionary genomic landscape of EACs with the presence of heterogeneous driver mutations, parallel evolution, early genome doubling events and an association between high intratumor heterogeneity and poor response to NAC. Multi-region sequencing demonstrated a significant reduction in T&gt;G mutations within a CTT context when comparing early and late mutational processes and the presence of a platinum signature with enrichment of C&gt;A mutations within a CpC context following NAC.

In contrast to the stability of genetic events, epigenetic states are reversible and sensitive to the microenvironment, prompting the question whether epigenetics can be similarly used to discover tumor phylogeny. We examined the spatial and temporal dynamics of DNA methylation in a cohort of low-grade gliomas and their patient-matched recurrences. Genes upregulated through promoter hypomethylation during malignant progression to high-grade glioblastoma were enriched in cell cycle function, evolving in parallel with genetic alterations that deregulate the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint. Moreover, phyloepigenetic relationships robustly recapitulated phylogenetic patterns inferred from somatic mutations. These findings highlight widespread co-dependency of genetic and epigenetic events throughout brain tumor evolution."

To evaluate the clinical implications of genomic alterations in this tumor type, we performed whole-exome analyses of 24 tumors, targeted genomic analyses of 77 tumors, and used non-invasive approaches to examine tumor-specific mutations in the circulation of these patients.  These analyses reveal somatic mutations in chromatin regulating genes MLL, MLL2, MLL3, and ARID1A in 20% of patients that were associated with improved survival.  We observe alterations in genes with potential clinical utility in over a third of cases.  Liquid biopsy analyses demonstrate that 43% of patients with localized disease have detectable circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) at diagnosis.  Detection of ctDNA after resection predicts clinical relapse and poor outcome, and recurrence by ctDNA is detected 6.5 months earlier than with CT imaging.  These observations provide genetic predictors of outcome in pancreatic cancer and have implications for new avenues of therapeutic intervention."

We developed a standardized quantitative protocol called STEM-RET to compare eye field specification, optic cup formation, and retinal differentiation across stem cell populations. We reprogrammed individual rod photoreceptors into iPSCs by inducible expression of Oct3/4, Klf4, Sox2, and Myc. We also developed ESC lines from rods by somatic cell nuclear transfer. Using the STEM-RET protocol, we compared the abilities of ESCs, fibroblast-derived iPSCs (f-iPSCs), rod photoreceptor-derived iPSCs (r-iPSCs), and rod photoreceptorderived ESCs to form retinae using STEM-RET. r-iPSCs were the most efficient at producing differentiated retina. Retinae derived from f-iPSCs lacked an inner nuclear layer (INL) and had a concomitant reduction in amacrine cells and other INL cell populations. The INL-specific LIM homeobox gene, Lhx9, was hypermethylated in fiPSCs and concomitantly downregulated in retinae derived from those stem cells. ChIP-seq analysis for H3K36me3, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9/14Ac, H3K27me3, H3K9me3, CTCF and 5 hydroxymethyl cytosine showed that the major difference between the r-iPSCs and the f-iPSCs were in the genes marked by the CTCF insulator protein. Importantly, CTCF binding enrichment at rod photoreceptor specific genes was at least 10-fold higher in r-iPSCs relative to f-iPSCs. Taken together, our data suggest that both inhibitory and permissive epigenetic marks important for retinal development can be retained in iPSCs and such marks can be exploited to select the most favorable stem cell population to study retinal development or produce photoreceptor precursors for cell transplantation."""

Recent next generation sequencing studies revealed an accumulation of tumor-associated mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) which may also contribute to the activation of survival pathways in MM. To investigate the clinical role of RTK-mutations in MM, we deep-sequenced the coding DNA-sequence of EGFR, EPHA2, ERBB3, IGF1R, NTRK1 and NTRK2 which were previously found to be mutated in MM, in 75 uniformly treated MM patients of the ""Deutsche Studiengruppe Multiples Myelom"". Subsequently, we correlated the detected mutations with common cytogenetic alterations and clinical parameters. We identified 11 novel non-synonymous SNVs or rare patient-specific SNPs, not listed in the SNP databases 1000 genomes and dbSNP, in 10 primary MM cases. The mutations predominantly affected the tyrosine-kinase and ligand-binding domains and no correlation with cytogenetic parameters was found. Interestingly, however, patients with RTK-mutations, specifically those with rare patient-specific SNPs, showed a significant lower overall, event-free and progression-free survival.

Recent whole exome sequencing of human HNSCC has highlighted the heterogeneity of the underlying genetic lesions (Agrawal et al., 2011; Stransky et al., 2011). One of the most intriguing findings from whole exome sequencing is the high frequency of inactivating mutations in NOTCH1. The aim of our project is to unravel at what stage in tumour development the epithelium acquires the p53, Notch, Caspase 8 and FAT1 mutations, that are a hallmark of the human cancer, and the impact on different cell types, using a mouse model of carcinogen induced oral SCC. Furthermore, identifying epithelial and stromal alterations that reflect genetic mutations will provide indicators offering an exciting strategy for diagnosis and treatment of cancer."

The genomic landscape of breast cancer is complex, and inter- and intra-tumour heterogeneity are important challenges in treating the disease.  In this study, we sequence 173 genes in 2433 primary breast tumours that have copy number aberration (CNA), gene expression, and long-term clinical follow-up data.  We identify 40 mutation-driver (Mut-driver) genes, and determine associations between mutations, driver CNA profiles, clinical-pathological parameters, and survival.  We assess the clonal states of Mut-driver mutations, and estimate levels of intratumour heterogeneity using mutant allele fractions.   Associations between PIK3CA mutations and reduced survival are identified in three subgroups of ER-positive cancer (defined by amplification of 17q23, 11q13-14 or 8q24).  High levels of intratumour heterogeneity are in general associated with worse outcome, but highly aggressive tumours with 11q13-14 amplification have low levels of intratumour heterogeneity.  These results emphasise the importance of genome-based stratification of breast cancer, and have important implications for designing therapeutic strategies."

Previous studies indicate that, in adult mice, this property is ultimately vested in cells uniquely identified by their ability to clonally regenerate detectable levels of mature blood cells in serially transplanted recipients. We now present a combined multi-parameter analysis of the molecular features of very primitive human cord blood cells that display different cell output activities in vitro and in vivo. These analyses identified a new, prospectively separable, but still functionally heterogeneous, subset of long-term human blood-forming cells. Single-cell measurements of their transcriptional, DNA methylation and 40-protein content and of closely related phenotypes revealed numerous subtle, but consistent differences both within and between each subset analyzed. These results suggest that multiple regulatory mechanisms underlie the functional heterogeneity exhibited by clonally tracked human blood cell precursors with long-term output abilities."

This stage between localised and systemic disease is key to understanding breast cancer progression, however our knowledge of the evolution of lymph node malignant invasion remains limited, as most currently available data derive from primary tumours. Experimental design: In 11 treatment-naïve node positive early breast cancer patients without clinical evidence of distant metastasis, we investigated lymph node evolution using spatial multi-region sequencing (n=78 samples) of primary and lymph node deposits and genomic profiling of matched longitudinal circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA). Results: Linear evolution from primary to lymph node was rare (1/11) whereas the majority of cases displayed either early divergence between primary and nodes (4/11), or no detectable divergence (6/11) where both primary and nodal cells belonged to a single recent expansion of a metastatic clone. Divergence of metastatic subclones was driven in part by APOBEC. Longitudinal ctDNA samples from 2 subjects taken peri-operatively reflected the two major evolutionary patterns and demonstrate that private mutations can be detected even from early metastatic nodal deposits. Moreover, node removal resulted in disappearance of private lymph node mutations in ctDNA.Conclusions: This study sheds new light on a crucial evolutionary step in the natural history of breast cancer, demonstrating early establishment of axillary lymph node metastasis in a substantial proportion of patients."

Evolution of the active mutational processes was distinct in each group, with the early branching group having a significant increase in Signature 17 activity after branching. Characterization of mutations and gene expression between primary and relapse samples revealed continuous patient-specific pathway addiction in relapse.

EGAS00001002966,contribution  allelic imbalance  colorectal cancer,"Point mutations in cancer have been extensively studied but chromosomal gains and losses have been more challenging to interpret due to their unspecific nature. Here we examine high-resolution allelic imbalance (AI) landscape in 1699 colorectal cancers, 256 of which have been whole genome sequenced (WGSed). The imbalances pinpoint 38 genes as plausible AI targets based on previous knowledge, and unbiased CRISPR-Cas9 knockout and activation screens identified altogether 79 genes within AI peaks regulating cell growth. Genetic and functional data implicates loss of TP53 as a sufficient driver of AI. The WGS highlights an influence of copy number aberrations on the rate of detected somatic point mutations. Importantly, the data reveal several associations between AI target genes, suggesting a role for a network of lineage-determining transcription factors in colorectal tumorigenesis. Overall, the results unravel the contribution of AI in colorectal cancer and provide a plausible explanation why so few genes are commonly affected by point mutations in cancers."
EGAS00001001564,immunoseq  paper,"Background: Comprehensive DNase I hypersensitive site (DHS) mapping by the ENCODE and NIH Roadmap Epigenomics projects has identified many classes of cis-regulatory elements. Studies have shown an enrichment of complex trait GWAS hits in these DHS regions. However, given that most of these loci are in non-coding DNA, their genetic makeup remains largely unexplored, as most recent studies of complex traits have been restricted to whole-exome sequencing. The discovery of rare non-coding variants located in regulatory regions that are specific to immune cells should further explain their role in complex traits. Results: We designed a custom capture panel to identify and assess the impact of rare non-coding variation in immune and chronic inflammatory diseases. Our approach combines selective DNA capture of relevant regulatory regions with next-generation sequencing. Genome-wide DHS mapping data from the ENCODE and NIH Roadmap Epigenomics projects was used to locate the regulatory regions of immune cells. We first applied the “Immunoseq” assay to 30 healthy individuals where we had existing transcriptome data from T cells. Using Immunoseq, we identified a large number of novel non-coding variants in these samples. Relying on allele specific expression measurements, we also showed that our selected capture regions are enriched for functional variants that have an impact on differential allelic gene expression. The results from a replication set with 180 samples confirmed our observations. Conclusions: We show that the Immunoseq is a powerful approach to detect novel rare variants in regulatory regions. We also demonstrate that these novel variants have a potential functional role in immune cells."

EGAS00001001567,imprinting  skin inflammation homing  cd4 t cells  controlled  dna methylation   fucosyltransferase 7 gene,"CD4+ effector/memory cells use E- and P-selectin ligands (E- and P-ligs) for homing to the skin and acute inflamed regions, whereas α4β7 and CCR9 promote homing into the gut. Retinoic acid (RA) is a key inducer of gut-homing while concomitantly suppressing skin homing. In this study, we found that high expression of fucosyltransferase 7 (fut7), the enzyme crucial for generation of the glycosylated E- and P-ligs in T cells, correlates with DNA demethylation within a minimal promoter of the fut7 gene in skin/inflammation-seeking effector/memory T cells. RA abrogated the activation-induced demethylation of this region, which contains a cAMP responsive element (CRE) sequence. Methylation of the promoter or mutation of the CRE binding site abolished promoter activity confirming the importance of this region and of its demethylation for fut7 transcriptional activity in T cells. Furthermore, human CD4+ effector/memory T cells showed intragenic demethylation corresponding to high Fut7 expression, while non-hematopoetic cells – lacking selectin ligand expression – such as hepatocytes, exhibit extensive methylation of the fut7 gene. In conclusion, we show that the topographic commitment of T cells for skin and inflammation is imprinted by DNA demethylation within a minimal promoter of the fut7 gene that is conserved across human and mouse."

EGAS00001001611,fetalquant sd accurate quantification  fetal dna fraction  shallow depth sequencing  maternal plasma dna,"Noninvasive prenatal testing using massively parallel sequencing of maternal plasma DNA has been rapidly adopted in clinical use worldwide. Fetal DNA fraction in a maternal plasma sample is an important parameter for accurate interpretations of these tests. However, there is a lack of methods involving low-sequencing depth and yet would allow a robust and accurate determination of fetal DNA fraction in maternal plasma for all pregnancies. In this study, we have developed a new method to accurately quantify the fetal DNA fraction by analysing the maternal genotypes and sequencing data of maternal plasma DNA. Fetal DNA fraction was calculated based on the proportion of non-maternal alleles at single-nucleotide polymorphisms where the mother is homozygous. This new approach achieves a median deviation of 0.6% between predicted fetal DNA fraction and the actual fetal DNA fraction using as low as 0.03-fold sequencing coverage of the human genome. We believe that this method will further enhance the clinical interpretations of noninvasive prenatal testing using genome-wide random sequencing."

EGAS00001002996,host  genome variations  associated  neurocognitive outcome  survivors  pediatric medulloblastoma,"Host whole genome analysis is a promising source of predictive information for long-term morbidity in cancer survivors. However, studies on genetic predictors of long-term outcome, particularly neurocognitive function following chemoradiation in pediatric oncology are limited. In the present study, we evaluated variations in host whole genome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their association with cognitive outcome. Whole-genome SNP analysis of host peripheral blood was conducted on 22 medulloblastoma long-term survivors, of whom 18 completed neuropsychological testing. First, unsupervised consensus clustering of the most variable SNPs within 409 genes involved in DNA repair was performed. Discrete variant groups were identified, although they were not associated with cognitive outcome, suggesting that variations in genes corresponding to a single functional group may be insufficient to predict long-term outcome alone. In support of this interpretation, unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis using disease-associated gene variants by cognitive impairment status yielded two distinct variant clusters comprised of 36 variants, 34 of which were in noncoding regions. These findings illustrate for the first time that cognitively impaired survivors have a distinct variant profile compared to other medulloblastoma survivors. Future research in larger cohorts is needed to validate host genome predictors of cognitive impairment that may impact clinical management."

To address spatial heterogeneity, we analyzed 134 specimens from various neuroanatomical structures of whole autopsy brains from nine DIPG patients. Evolutionary reconstruction indicates histone 3 (H3)K27M – including novel H3.2K27M - mutations potentially arise first and are invariably associated with specific, high-fidelity obligate partners throughout the tumor and its spread, from diagnosis to end-stage disease, suggesting mutual need for tumorigenesis. These H3K27M ubiquitously-associated mutations involve alterations in TP53 cell-cycle (TP53/PPM1D) or specific growth factor pathways (ACVR1/PIK3R1). Later oncogenic alterations arise in sub-clones and often affect the PI3K pathway. Our findings are consistent with early tumor spread outside the brainstem including the cerebrum. The spatial and temporal homogeneity of driver mutations in DIPG implies they will be captured by limited biopsies and emphasizes the need to develop therapies specifically targeting obligate oncohistone partnerships."

Importance: Chordomas are rare tumors of the axial skeleton and skull base with few therapeutic options and no clinically validated molecular drug targets. The value of comprehensive genomic analyses for guiding medical therapy of patients with advanced-stage chordoma is unknown.Objective: To identify therapeutically tractable genetic lesions in a cohort of chordoma patients within a genomics-guided precision oncology program and to document the outcome of individualized, molecularly targeted chordoma therapy.Design, Setting, and Participants: We performed whole-exome sequencing of tumor and matched germline control samples from seven patients with locally advanced or metastatic chordoma who were enrolled in a cross-institutional molecular stratification registry trial for younger adults with advanced-stage cancer across all histologies and patients with rare tumors. All patients were heavily pretreated and had progressive disease prior to molecular analysis.Interventions: Individualized medical therapy was administered according to the patients’ molecular profiles.Main Outcomes and Measures: Candidate therapeutic targets identified by whole-exome sequencing and response to genotype-directed therapy.Results: All patients harbored alterations of two or more genes known to be involved in DNA repair via homologous recombination (HR), including heterozygous deletions of ERCC6, FANC family members, RAD51L (n = 6), BRCA2 (n = 5), ATR, CHEK2, RAD18, RAD51B, and XRCC3 (n = 4); inactivating PTEN mutations coupled with loss of heterozygosity (n = 2); and pathogenic germline variants in BRCA2 (n = 1), NBN (n = 1), and CHEK2 (n = 1) that were accompanied by somatic deletion of the corresponding wild-type alleles. Consistently, a mutational signature associated with defective HR was enriched in all samples and co-occurred with extensive genomic instability, as evidenced by HR deficiency scores and high numbers of large-scale state transitions. These results prompted off-label treatment with the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib in a patient whose tumor was refractory to irradiation and systemic treatment with imatinib, which led to a prolonged response and substantial clinical improvement.Conclusions and Relevance: Advanced-stage chordomas are frequently characterized by genomic imprints of defective HR DNA repair. HR deficiency represents a new therapeutic opportunity in this intractable disease through repositioning of PARP inhibitors that warrants further exploration in clinical trials."
EGAS00001001673, rnaseq analysis  human ips derived macrophages infected   capsulated   capsulated klebsiella pnuemoniae,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is a gram-negative pathogen which can cause a wide range of infections from urinary tractinfections to pneumonia and is considered a major threat to public health. While commensal carriage (e.g. skin andnasopharynx and gastrointestinal tract) is common, Klebsiella can become pathogenic in individuals withcompromised immunity.  It is a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections, commonly presenting as pneumonia,urinary tract infection and sepsis.  In addition, Klebsiella also causes community-acquired infections with seriouscomplications, such as liver abscess and meningitis.  Despite the disease burden and escalating prevalence of multi-drug resistance, not much is known about the initial interaction between the bacterial and host cells, presenting anunder-exploited opportunity for therapeutic and/or prophylactic interventions targeting the early stage of pathogenencounter.A key determinant of Klebsiella’s pathogenicity is the thick outer layer of polysaccharide known as the capsule.  It hasbeen suggested that variation in the Klebsiella capsular serotype impacts on its internalisation by epithelial cells andmacrophages, however, critical details of cellular and molecular factors remain incompletely understood. We haveinitiated in vitro studies using both capsulated and non-capsulated engineered forms of Klebsiella pnuemoniae toinfect macrophages derived from differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells. The aim of our study is toanalyse the global host response in an attempt to establish transcriptional signatures that can be used for predictingdisease severity or outcome.  If this approach proves effective, the next step will be to use this system with a carefulselection of Klebsiella clinical isolates that encompasses all three (sub)species (KpI, KpII and KpIII) and includevariations in capsular serovars, infected site and community versus hospital acquired infections.We would like to request funds to sequence replicates of the RNA from capsulated and non-capsulated Klebsiellainfected macrophages at a fixed time point of infectionThis data is part of a pre-publication release.

Crucial steps in the development of next-generation probiotics are the design of formulations with a reasonable shelf life as well as the safety demonstration of an intervention in healthy volunteers. One such potential next-generation butyrate-producing probiotic is Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum 25-3T, with demonstrated safety in in vitro as well as in animal models. Here, we examined the strain's safety, tolerability, and impact on microbiota composition and metabolic activity in healthy volunteers in a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 30 healthy volunteers. Study design consisted of two four-week intervention periods (108 CFU B. pullicaecorum [treatment] or maltodextrin [placebo] per day) with a three-week washout in between. We assessed adverse events, blood parameters (primary endpoints), and fecal microbiota composition and metabolite profiles (secondary endpoints).The number of reported adverse events during the B. pullicaecorum treatment was similar to placebo intervention, as were observed changes in blood chemistry parameters, bowel habits, and fecal calprotectin concentrations. Administration of the strain did not induce any disruptive effect in microbiota composition or metabolic activity. In this first human intervention trial with a butyrate-producing Clostridium cluster IV isolate, we demonstrated B. pullicaecorum 25-3T administration to be both safe and well tolerated by healthy participants. This safety study paves the way for the further development of the strain as a next-generation probiotic."
EGAS00001003279,unravelling sepsis heterogeneity  trascriptomics bioaid ucl,"There is marked heterogeneity in the septic response, which has hindered efforts to understand pathophysiology and develop targeted therapies. Molecular approaches may provide insights into variation in the host response, enabling biomarker development. Recent evidence suggests that transcriptomic sepsis response signatures (SRSs) can define patient subgroups associated with early outcome in sepsis. In this context, using transcriptomic approaches, the co-applicants were the first to identify differential gene signatures, or immune endotypes, correlating with outcome in sepsis, (Davenport E. et al, The Lancet Respiratory medicine, 2016); potentially providing a path to personalised treatment in sepsis. Specifically, this work defined two groups based on transcriptomic profiles: SRS group 1 being more associated with endotoxin tolerance demonstrating an immunosuppressed signature and is associated with higher mortality, whereas, SRS2 is more immune-heightened. However, despite the importance of these findings, previous studies have been underpowered, and limited in depth of data, to resolve these endophenotypes further. In this context, the Bioresource for Adult Infectious Disease (BioAID) offers substantial opportunities in terms of power, depth and breadth of data linked to biological samples of patients presenting acutely with the sepsis syndrome across the UK.  BioAID currently holds samples for DNA, RNA, serum and microbial isolates for more than 4,000 individuals (with a planned recruit of 10,000 individuals) and therefore provides a powerful resource for examining the underlying biology and correlates of sepsis syndrome with a view to informing early risk stratification of patients, need for critical care, and treatments.

Indeed, circadian misalignments are strongly associated with high rates of metabolic disorders. Molecular makeup of the circadian oscillator can be deciphered in cells cultured in vitro, and these cellular rhythms are highly informative of the physiological circadian rhythm in vivo.We aimed at assessing molecular clock properties in dermal fibroblasts established from the skin biopsies of seventeen Type 2 diabetic obese and non-obese patients and eleven healthy controls. Following in vitro synchronization, primary fibroblast cultures were subjected to continuous assessment of circadian bioluminescence profiles based on lentiviral luciferase reporters. We observed a strong inverse correlation between HbA1c values and circadian period length within cells from the Type 2 diabetic group. RNA sequencing analysis conducted in this group samples revealed that ICAM1 encoding for the endothelial adhesion protein was differentially expressed between Type 2 diabetic compensated and non-compensated fibroblasts, and correlated with the period length. Furthermore, ICAM1 expression is driven by rhythmic CLOCK binding. We provide for the first time a potential molecular link between severity of Type 2 diabetes and circadian clock machinery, which paves a way for further mechanistic understanding of circadian oscillator changes upon Type 2 diabetes in humans."

We here present an extended framework for CRC stratification that specifically aims to improve patient prognostication. Using transcriptional profiles from 1,100 CRCs, including a novel set of &gt;300 samples, we identify novel cancer cell and tumor archetypes and suggest the tumor microenvironment as a major prognostic determinant that can be influenced by the microbiome. Notably, our subtyping strategy allowed identification of novel archetype-specific prognostic biomarkers that provided information beyond and independent of UICC-TNM staging, MSI-status and consensus molecular subtyping. The results illustrate that our extended subtyping framework, combining subtyping and subtype-specific biomarkers, could contribute to improved patient prognostication and may form a strong basis for future studies."

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the cornerstone of management for advanced disease. The use of androgen deprivation therapies is associated with multiple side effects, including metabolic syndrome and truncal obesity. At the same time, obesity has been associated with both prostate cancer development and disease progression, linked to its effects on chronic inflammation at a tissue level. The connection between androgen deprivation therapy, obesity, inflammation, and prostate cancer progression is well-established in clinical settings; however, an understanding of the changes in adipose tissue at the molecular level induced by castrating therapies is missing. Here we investigated the transcriptional changes in periprostatic fat tissue induced by profound androgen deprivation therapy in a group of patients with high-risk tumours compared to a matching untreated cohort. We find that androgen deprivation therapy is associated with a pro-inflammatory and obesity-like adipose tissue microenvironment. This study suggests that the beneficial effect of androgen deprivation therapy may be partially counteracted by metabolic and inflammatory side effects in the adipose tissue surrounding the prostate."

Nevertheless, outcomes of relapsed BCP-ALL remain unsatisfactory, particularly in adult patients where the molecular basis of relapse is still poorly understood. To elucidate the evolution of relapse in BCP-ALL, we established a comprehensive multi-omics dataset including DNA-sequencing, RNA-sequencing, DNA methylation array and proteome MASS-spec data from matched diagnosis and relapse samples of BCP-ALL patients (n = 50) including the subtypes DUX4, Ph-like and two aneuploid subtypes. Relapse-specific alterations were enriched for chromatin modifiers, nucleotide and steroid metabolism including the novel candidates FPGS, AGBL and ZNF483. The proteome expression analysis unraveled deregulation of metabolic pathways at relapse including the key proteins G6PD, TKT, GPI and PGD. Moreover, we identified a novel relapse-specific gene signature specific for DUX4 BCP-ALL patients highlighting chemotaxis and cytokine environment as a possible driver event at relapse. This study presents novel insights at distinct molecular levels of relapsed BCP-ALL based on a comprehensive multi-omics integrated data set including a valuable proteomics data set. The relapse specific aberrations reveal metabolic signatures on genomic and proteomic levels in BCP-ALL relapse. Furthermore, the chemokine expression signature in DUX4 relapse underscores the distinct status of DUX4-fusion BCP-ALL."

Here we reveal the precise direction of metastatic spread across four lethal prostate cancer patients using whole-genome and ultra-deep targeted sequencing of longitudinally collected primary and metastatic tumours. We find one case of metastatic spread to the surgical bed causing local recurrence, and another case of cross-metastatic site seeding combining with dynamic remoulding of subclonal mixtures in response to therapy. By ultra-deep sequencing end-stage blood, we detect both metastatic and primary tumour clones, even years after removal of the prostate. Analysis of mutations associated with metastasis reveals an enrichment of TP53 mutations, and additional sequencing of metastases from 19 patients demonstrates that acquisition of TP53 mutations is linked with the expansion of subclones with metastatic potential which we can detect in the blood."
EGAS00001003641,rna seq   tool  evaluating human embryo competence,"The majority of embryos that are created through IVF do not implant. One possibility for this inefficiency is an incomplete understanding of the molecular factors affecting embryo competence. Currently, the process of selecting an embryo for uterine transfer utilizes an ad-hoc combination of morphological criteria, the kinetics of development, and genetic testing for aneuploidy. However, no single criterion can ensure selection of a viable embryo. In contrast, RNA-sequencing of embryos could yield highly dimensional data, which may provide additional insight and illuminate the discrepancies among current selection criteria. Indeed, recent advances enabling the production of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries from single cells have facilitated the application of this technique to the study of some transcriptional events in early human development. However, these studies have not assessed the quality of their constituent embryos relative to commonly used embryological criteria. Here, we perform proof-of-principle advancement to clinical selection procedures by generating high quality RNA-seq libraries from a trophectoderm biopsy as well as the remaining whole embryo. We combine state-of-the-art embryological methods with low-input RNA-seq to develop the first transcriptome-wide approach for use in future predictive embryology studies. Specifically, we demonstrate the capacity of RNA-seq as a promising tool in preimplantation screening by showing that biopsies of an embryo can capture valuable information content available in the whole embryo from which they are derived. Furthermore, we show that this technique can be used to generate a RNA-based digital karyotype, and to develop a foundational dataset for identifying candidate competence-associated genes.

Here, we set out to identify subgroup-specific mutational patterns and pathway regulation. Whole-genome-sequencing was performed on 62 samples across all MCs and WHO grades from 62 patients with matched blood control, including 40 sporadic and 22 radiation-induced (Mrad) meningiomas. RNA sequencing was added for 18 cases and chromatin-immunoprecipitation for the enhancer mark H3K27ac followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) for 16 samples.

Besides the known mutations in meningioma, structural alterations were found to contribute to the spectrum of mechanisms inactivating NF2 in sporadic meningioma similar to previous reports for Mrad. Aberrations of DMD were found to be enriched in MCs with NF2 mutations and DMD was among the most differentially upregulated genes in NF2 mutant compared to NF2 wild-type cases. The mutational signature AC3 was detected in both sporadic meningioma and Mrad, but distributed across the genome in sporadic cases and enriched near genomic breakpoints in Mrad. In general, the malignant MC presented a significantly higher exposure to AC3 and higher genomic instability beyond the mutational load than the other MCs. Pathway analysis of the ChIP-seq clusters revealed that the FOXM1 is most differentially activated in high-grade cases, along with super enhancer recruitment near HOX genes and respective upregulation of expression.

This data further elucidate the biological mechanisms differentiating meningiomas of different WHO grade and epigenetic subgroups and suggest leveraging the genomic instability as novel therapeutic targets."

We sequenced more than 250,000 B cells from rat, mouse and human repertoires to characterize their lineages and expansion. In addition, we immunized rats with chicken ovalbumin and profiled antigen-reactive B cells from lymph nodes of immunized animals. The scBCR-seq data recovered 81% (n = 56/69) of B-cell lineages identified from hybridomas generated from the same set of B cells that were subjected to scBCR-seq. Importantly, scBCR-seq identified an additional 710 candidate lineages that were not recovered as hybridomas. We synthesized, expressed and tested 93 clones from the identified lineages and found that 99% (n = 92/93) of the clones were antigen-reactive. Our results establish scBCR-seq as a powerful tool for antibody discovery."

To gain insight into how enhancer variation influences diabetes risk, we created promoter capture Hi-C maps in human pancreatic islets. This linked diabetes-associated islet enhancers with their target genes, often located hundreds of kilobases away. We identified hubs that show spatial and functional connections between enhancersand target genes related to islet function and diabetes. We demonstrate that genetic variants distributed across hub enhancers have a major impact on T2D heritability, and use this knowledge to identify individuals in whom islet regulatory variation has a prominent role in T2D risk. Our results demonstrate the importance of 3D chromatin architecture for molecular interpretation of T2D genetic association signals, and define genomic spaces that harbor a distinct component of the T2D polygenic burden."

EGAS00001003665,synthetic rna modulators  chd1l transcription,"While the scale of GWAS, and number of discovered loci associated with traits has substantially increased over the past decade, functional validation, and understanding of underlying biology driving these associations has lagged behind; limiting translation of these discoveries into therapeutic applications. In this context, synthetic RNA modulators of gene function provide an efficient, and high-throughput mechanism for validation of discoveries in cellular models, providing a platform for interrogation and translation of findings from GWAS, into therapeutic applications within an integrated platform. An improvement in our understanding of the regulation of gene functions by different types of RNA modulators, and the technological development in the field of synthetic RNA molecules, has enabled high-throughput functional assays of cellular phenotypes in multiple cellular models, as well as opportunities to translate these discoveries directly into therapeutics. Complementary to this, recent development of deep learning approaches to effectively predict miRNA-target associations (Rayner et al., 2017) and promoter regions have provided a rich database of computationally predicted modulators of gene function for functional validation. We propose a high-throughput screen of 380 synthetic RNA molecules across 15 genes identified as associated with cardiometabolic and other traits through multiple lines of evidence (GWAS, eQTL, functional studies, and/or mouse phenotyping). We will use a range of synthetic RNA molecules to target a set of genes of interest in cellular models (HepG2 cell lines), to examine changes in target gene expression (efficacy), immunogenicity and cell-viability. Promoters will be identified through existing databases, and deep learning and bioinformatics approaches; we will also use predicted miRNA-target associations identified through deep learning frameworks trained on experimental evidence (Rayner et al., 2017), as part of an established collaboration. Alongside integrated genetic and EHR data, such datasets provide the opportunity to align multidimensional data to understand loci associated with disease, and identify potential therapeutic targets.

EGAS00001003666,gdap genome diversity  africa project,"The Genomic Diversity in Africa Project (GDAP) started with the plan to develop a genomic resource from African populations, characterise genomic diversity and population history, and facilitate clinical studies in Africa. Currently, 25 individuals from 24 ethnolinguistic groups have been whole-genome sequenced at high depth totalling 585 individuals. An additional 41 individuals have been sequenced with 10X Genomics libraries. At this stage, the initial curation of this dataset has been finished and we are performing the analysis in coordination with our collaborators. The current state of the GDAP represents a very diverse panel of African populations that maximizes geographical and ethnic variation and represents a great starting point to achieve the aforementioned goals. However, southern sub-Saharan countries, Bantu speakers and hunter gatherer groups are currently underrepresented, despite being crucial to understand the evolutionary history of the continent. After extensive effort to collate studies documentation, we finally have the opportunity to sequence 600 new individuals from these groups, including countries as Gabon, Rwanda and Zambia, and address these deficiencies. We aim to proceed with the same strategy: to sequence at high depth 25 individuals with standard PCR free libraries, with 2 additional individuals with 10X Genomics Chromium libraries per ethnolinguistic group. The former allows a good representation of variants down to low frequency in any given population, and the latter allows accurate phasing and the analysis of structural variation. By including these new populations, we want to investigate three crucial questions in African history in addition to the initial objectives: the Bantu expansion, the evolutionary history of hunter gatherers and the transatlantic slave trade. Additionally, the expanded dataset will help us better discover the genetic variation present in Africa and characterize the African pangenome.

EGAS00001000553,genome diveristy  africa project khoe san wgs,"The Genome Diversity in Africa Project focus on sequencing the whole genome of less studied, genetically diverse groups within sub-Saharan Africa with the objective of detailed characterisation of genetic variation within Africa. African populations show the greatest genetic diversity, with genetic variation in Eurasia, Oceania and the Americas largely being a subset of the African diversity. Within Africa, click-speaking southern African San and Khoe populations have been repeatedly shown to have the greatest genomic diversity and likely represent the deepest historical population divergences among existing human populations [1]. However, these African populations are under-represented in genome-wide studies of genetic diversity, and studies assessing the ethnic diversity within the Khoe-San in southern Africa have focused on few individuals or markers within each ethnic group. The study of these groups can provide important insights into the evolutionary adaptations related to lifestyle differences and environmental factors. For instance, whole genome sequence data from a single Khoe-San individual (!Gubi) has provided important insights into the genetic diversity of indigenous hunter-gatherer in relation to Bantu populations and has revealed biologically relevant loci under selection in these groups with respect to populations that have adopted a farming lifestyle [2]. Assembly of sequence data from this individual also unveiled several genomic regions that correspond to gaps in the current understanding of the human assembly [2]. Large scale sequencing efforts of the highly diverse Khoe-San populations, besides providing unique opportunities to explore human history, would facilitate inclusion of these groups in genetic association studies of disease, rendering the latter more informative. Capturing this previously unexplored diversity would also allow the development of novel reference panels for imputation, providing a more suitable platform for imputation of rare haplotypes unique to sub-Saharan Africa, especially to South African populations, where a large proportion of Khoe-San admixture is seen. The Nama are a Khoe group distinguished by a pastoralist lifestyle in contrast to the hunter-gatherer lifestyle of the San groups; yet they show great genetic similarity to the Southern San groups, such as ?Khomani and Karretjie [1]. In this study, we plan to carry out whole Version: September 2011 Page 2 of 5 genome sequencing (4x) on samples from 110 individuals belonging to the Nama ethnic group, with the objective of examining the genetic diversity in these individuals, and differentiation of loci with respect to other African populations. These data will also contribute to a larger African reference panel for imputation incorporating whole genome sequencing data from diverse populations across Africa. We will also genotype the same individuals using the Illumina Human OmniChip 2.5M array, to provide validation of genotype calling from sequence data, as well as to provide a scaffold for better phasing and refinement of genotypes, as it has been shown previously [3].

EGAS00001003283,genome wide association study  vaccine response  infants  subsaharan africa,"In sub-Saharan Africa, many vaccines have been shown to have reduced efficacy relative to
Europe and North America. Both environmental and genetic factors are known to be
responsible for this variation, including adaptive evolutionary changes in the human and
pathogen genome. Previous findings suggest that there may several genes residing outside
of the HLA locus that may influence genetic susceptibility to infection, response to treatment s
and vaccine efficacy. We therefore propose a GWAS to identify variants associated with a
differential response to some of the most commonly used vaccines. This study will be unique
in analysing multiple vaccines simultaneously, which could provide not only the opportunity to
detect new genetic determinants of vaccine response and replicate biological candidate
genes, but also provide insights into whether the molecular mechanisms responsible for
vaccine efficacy differ among different disease vaccines and subtypes. The identification of
novel genes and pathways associated with variable vaccine response should help us to
develop more immunogenic and effective vaccines both against those diseases for which
vaccines already exist, and also against other major infections.
We aim to genotype 1,500 children from the Entebbe Mother and Baby (EMaB) study, an ongoing
birth cohort in southern Uganda, using the Illumina HumanOmni 2.5M chip array.
Measures of serological response at one year to seven vaccinations received in infancy

EGAS00001003448,genomic landscape  lymphoepithelioma  hepatocellular carcinoma,"Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinomas (LELC) are rare tumors that are characterized by a dense infiltration of tumor-associated lymphocytes, and often carry a good prognosis in patients. Lymphoepithelioma-like hepatocellular carcinoma (LEL-HCC) is an uncommon variant of HCC with little known about its pathogenesis and patterns of genomic alterations. In this study, we conducted whole-exome sequencing (WES) on a series of 12 cases LEL-HCC and compared findings to 15 cases of conventional HCC (Conven-HCC) that were sequenced in parallel. Overall, there were no significant difference in the somatic mutational burdens between LEL-HCC and Conven-HCC, except for a higher number of somatic insertion–deletion (indel) alterations suggested in LEL-HCC. The frequency of some specific genes (CTNNB1, AXIN1, NOTCH1, NOTCH2) was significantly lower in LEL-HCC than in Conven-HCC, suggesting a correlation between activation of the Wnt/β-catenin and Notch signaling pathway and lower recruitment of T-Cell Infiltration. At the CNV level, we found a higher incidence of chr.11q13.3 amplification in LEL-HCC cases (25% LEL-HCC vs 6.7% Conven-HCC). Using TCGA datasets, we further established that well-known driver genes expressed from chr.11q13.3 including CCND1 and FGF19 showed strong association with common immune response genes (such as CD8A and IFN-γ) within the tumor microenvironment. Our results illustrate for the first time the somatic landscape of LEL-HCC, and highlight molecular alterations that are likely drivers in this tumor type."
EGAS00001003509,clonal evolution   small cell lung cancer selects  copy number gains  mcl 1    exploited therapeutically hipo 021,"The critical role of mutated KRAS has been well-established in lung cancer. However, the inhibition of essential survival pathways in KRAS-mutated tumors remains ineffective. Here we explored non-oncogene addictions in non-small cell lung cancer by studying the clonal evolution of genes securing the continued survival of cancer cells. We identified subclonal copy-number gains of MCL-1 with high frequency in non-small cell lung cancer implying that the continued protection against cell death represents a critical prerequisite during tumor evolution. Using gene-targeted mouse models, we found that the sustained survival of cancer cells was dependent on MCL-1 even in the presence of alternative pro-survival BCL-2 members. KrasG12D-driven pulmonary adenocarcinoma development in mice required MCL-1 for optimal survival. Whereas the dependency on MCL-1 during tumor initiation was overcome by the additional loss of p53, pharmacologic targeting of MCL-1 in fully-established cancers was able to delay progression even when p53 was deleted. An altered immune cell repertoire in Mcl-1-deficient tumors indicated a STAT3-dependent resistance mechanisms and provided evidence that MCL-1-controlled cell death had immunogenic potential. In summary, we showed that MCL-1 amplifications in human non-small cell lung cancer represent a frequent genomic event during tumor evolution that protected cancer cells during tumor progression and thereby exemplifies a rational therapeutic target."
EGAS00001003667,rna seq   tool  evaluating human embryo competence,"The majority of embryos that are created through IVF do not implant. One possibility for this inefficiency is an incomplete understanding of the molecular factors affecting embryo competence. Currently, the process of selecting an embryo for uterine transfer utilizes an ad-hoc combination of morphological criteria, the kinetics of development, and genetic testing for aneuploidy. However, no single criterion can ensure selection of a viable embryo. In contrast, RNA-sequencing of embryos could yield highly dimensional data, which may provide additional insight and illuminate the discrepancies among current selection criteria. Indeed, recent advances enabling the production of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries from single cells have facilitated the application of this technique to the study of some transcriptional events in early human development. However, these studies have not assessed the quality of their constituent embryos relative to commonly used embryological criteria. Here, we perform proof-of-principle advancement to clinical selection procedures by generating high quality RNA-seq libraries from a trophectoderm biopsy as well as the remaining whole embryo. We combine state-of-the-art embryological methods with low-input RNA-seq to develop the first transcriptome-wide approach for use in future predictive embryology studies. Specifically, we demonstrate the capacity of RNA-seq as a promising tool in preimplantation screening by showing that biopsies of an embryo can capture valuable information content available in the whole embryo from which they are derived. Furthermore, we show that this technique can be used to generate a RNA-based digital karyotype, and to develop a foundational dataset for identifying candidate competence-associated genes. Together, these data establish the foundation for a future RNA-based diagnostic in IVF."

Thus, we performed RNA sequencing on 88 resected MBMs and 42 patient-matched extracranial metastases; tumors with sufficient tissue also underwent whole-exome sequencing, T-cell receptor sequencing, and IHC. MBMs demonstrated heterogeneity of immune infiltrates that correlated with prior radiation and post-craniotomy survival. Comparison with patient-matched extracranial metastases identified significant immunosuppression and enrichment of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in MBMs. Gene-expression analysis of intracranial and subcutaneous xenografts, and a spontaneous MBM model, confirmed increased OXPHOS gene expression in MBMs, which was also detected by direct metabolite profiling and [U-13C]-glucose tracing in vivo IACS-010759, an OXPHOS inhibitor currently in early-phase clinical trials, improved survival of mice bearing MAPK inhibitor-resistant intracranial melanoma xenografts and inhibited MBM formation in the spontaneous MBM model.

A better understanding of the generation and persistence of SI CD8 Trm cells in humans may have implications for intestinal immune-mediated diseases and vaccine development. Analyzing normal and transplanted human SI we demonstrated that the majority of SI CD8 T cells were bona fide CD8 Trm cells that survived for over 1 year in the graft. Intraepithelial and lamina propria CD8 Trm cells showed a high clonal overlap and a repertoire dominated by expanded clones, conserved both spatially in the intestine and over time. Functionally, lamina propria CD8 Trm cells were potent cytokine-producers, exhibiting a polyfunctional (IFN-γ+ IL-2+ TNF-α+) profile, and efficiently expressed cytotoxic mediators after stimulation. These results suggest that SI CD8 Trm cells could be relevant targets for future oral vaccines and therapeutic strategies for gut disorders."

By combining the expertise in pathogen biology, informatics and stem cell biology across the institute, this project will use targeted genetic modification in mouse embryonic stem cells to identify functions of host genes in innate immunity. We will also explore the biology of mouse embryonic stem cells and their differentiation into immune competent cells.

These will be subjected to a panel of immune challenge and stimulation assays to characterise the functions of the disrupted genes. 
To identify new functions for mammalian genes in innate immunity we will:
•	Generate a panel of homozygous inducible gene knockout mouse ES cell lines working from a list of ca. 80 candidate genes (MGP phenotyping and GWAS hits). 
•	Scale up differentiation protocols for immune challenge and stimulation assays.
•	Benchmark in vitro differentiated ES cell models against primary immune cells from selected MGP mouse lines and eventually against human iPS cells.
•	Screen a panel of 30 genetically modified cell lines in immunological challenge and stimulation assays, defining phenotypes at the cellular level by high content imaging, biochemically by assaying cytokine production, and at the molecular level by transcriptome analysis.
•	Define novel gene functions in innate immunity through network analysis of gene expression data from all challenged cell lines.
•	In the longer term scale up the production and phenotyping of genetically modified cell lines (mouse or human as appropriate).

We also identified recurrent mutations in TCF12 and in an additional series of 83 AO. Overall 7.5% of AO are mutated for TCF12, which encodes an oligodendrocyte-related transcription factor. 80% of TCF12 mutations identified were in either the bHLH domain, which is important for TCF12 function as a transcription factor, or were frame shift mutations leading to TCF12 truncated for this domain.

2.	How do in vivo perturbations, particularly chemotherapy and increased levels of reactive oxygen species, affect HSC population dynamics?
3.	Is response to in vitro perturbation heritable and/or correlated with other features such as age of individual and contribution of the lineage to peripheral blood?

Led by Mike Stratton, together with Paul Brennan, Ludmil Alexandrov, Allan Balmain, David Phillips and Peter Campbell, this large-scale international research endeavour was awarded a Cancer Research UK Grand Challenge. 

Different patterns of somatic mutation are generated by the different environmental, lifestyle and genetic factors that cause cancer, many of them are still unknown. Within Mutographs, the International Agency for Research on Cancer is coordinating the recruitment of 5000 individuals with cancer (colorectal, renal, pancreatic, oesophageal adenocarcinoma or oesophageal squamous cancers) across 5 continents to explore whether different mutational signatures explain marked variation in incidence. In brief, through an international network of collaborators around the world, biological materials are collected, along with demographic, histological, clinical and questionnaire data. Whole genome sequences of tumour-germline DNA pairs are generated at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (40X and 20X depth respectively). Somatic mutational signatures are subsequently extracted by non-negative matrix factorisation methods and correlated with risk factors data. 
Through an enhanced understanding of cancer aetiology, Mutographs unprecedented effort is anticipated to outline modifiable risk factors, lead to new approaches to prevent cancer, and provide opportunities to empower early detection, refine high-risk groups and contribute to further therapeutic development."

Here, we present a MS-based analytical pipeline that can precisely characterize the non-canonical HLAp repertoire, incorporating whole exome sequencing, bulk and single cell transcriptomics, ribosome profiling, and a combination of two MS/MS search tools. This approach results in the accurate identification of hundreds of shared and tumor-specific non-canonical HLAp.

Two tumors with wild-type RB1 had evidence of chromothripsis leading to overexpression of Cyclin D1, revealing an alternative mechanism of Rb1 deregulation. Thus, loss of the tumor suppressors TP53 and RB1 is obligatory in SCLC. We further discovered somatic genomic rearrangements of TP73 that create an oncogenic version of this gene, TP73Δex2/3. In few cases, SCLC tumors exhibited kinase gene mutations, providing a possible therapeutic opportunity for individual patients. Finally, we observed inactivating mutations in NOTCH family genes in 25% of human SCLC. Accordingly, activation of Notch signaling in a pre-clinical SCLC mouse model dramatically reduced the number of tumors and extended the survival of the mutant mice. Furthermore, neuroendocrine gene expression was abrogated by Notch activity in SCLC cells. This first comprehensive study of somatic genome alterations in SCLC uncovers several key biological processes and identifies candidate therapeutic targets in this highly lethal form of cancer."

These stages are definitive endoderm, foregut, early pancreatic progenitors, pancreatic progenitors, endocrine progenitors, early endocrine cells, and beta-like cells. After the pancreatic progenitor stage, the cell populations become too heterogenous to study gene expression in the cell type of interest using bulk RNA analysis. In addition, the different cell types that contribute to the heterogenity of the population are not well characterised. To address these issues, we would like to carry out single cell analysis at each major stage of the pancreatic differentiation protocol to; 
1.) investigate gene expression in our cell type of interest - especially at later stages of the protocol; 2.) characterise the other cell types present in the populations. 

We plan on performing these analyses for at least 2 wild-type cell lines, a HNF1B knockout line, and beta-like cells that have been treated with compounds known to affect glucose secretion.

Ependymomas are chemotherapy-resistant brain tumours, which, despite genomic sequencing, lack effective molecular targets. Here, we mapped active chromatin landscapes in 42 primary ependymomas in two non-overlapping primary ependymoma cohorts. Enhancer regions revealed novel oncogenes, molecular targets, and pathways, which when subjected to small molecule inhibitor or shRNA treatment, increased survival and slowed proliferation in mouse and neurosphere patient-derived models of ependymomas. This study represents one of the largest enhancer mapping study of any cancer type to date, and provides a framework for target and drug discovery for other cancers recalcitrant to therapeutic development because of their lack of known genetic drivers."

Understanding this genetic variation can provide insights into the evolutionary processes that shape both human adaptation and variation in disease. Populations from SSA have the highest levels of genetic diversity. This characteristic, in addition to historical genetic admixture, can lead to complexities in the design of studies assessing the genetic determinants of disease and human variation. However, such studies of African populations are also likely to provide new opportunities to discover novel disease susceptibility loci and variants and refine gene–disease association signals. A systematic assessment of genetic diversity within SSA would facilitate genomic epidemiological studies in the region.The Genome Diversity in Africa Project (GDAP) aims to produce a comprehensive catalogue of human genetic variation in SSA, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), structural variants, and haplotypes. This resource will make a substantial contribution to understanding patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations in SSA, as well as providing a global resource to help design, implement and interpret genomic studies in SSA populations and studies comprising globally diverse populations, complementing existing genomic resources. Specifically, we plan to carry out high depth whole genome sequencing of up to 2000 individuals across Africa (25 individuals from each ethnolinguistic group).Our scientific objectives are to: 1) develop a resource that provides a comprehensive catalogue of genetic variation in populations from SSA accessible to the global scientific community; 2) characterise population genetic diversity, structure, gene flow and admixture across SSA; 3) develop a cost-efficient, next-generation genotype array for diverse populations across SSA; and 4) facilitate whole genome-sequencing association studies of complex traits and diseases by developing a reference panel for imputation and resource for enhancing fine-mapping disease susceptibility loci.

The inclusion criteria were met by patients with large (&gt; 2.5 cm) Her2 negative tumors, with no signs of metastatic disease who had not received any previous treatment. Written informed consent forms were obtained from all patients. The study was approved by the institutional protocol review board, the regional ethics committee, the Norwegian Medicines Agency and was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, International Conference on Harmony/Good Clinical practice. The study was registered in the http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov/ database with the identifier NCT00773695.Women in both treatment arms of the study received four cycles of FEC100 (5FU 600mg/m2, epirubicine 100 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600mg/m2) given every three weeks, followed by 12 weekly infusions with paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) or four cycles with docetaxel (100 mg/m2), one every three weeks. Patients randomly assigned to the bevacizumab treatment arm received a 15 mg/kg dose on day one of each chemotherapy course, or a 10 mg/kg dose every other week when receiving paclitaxel. In a separate cohort of the study, a small subset of patients above 55 years of age and with hormone receptor positive tumors were treated with aromatase inhibitors (n = 12). The randomization to bevacizumab in this cohort were independent from the cohort receiving chemotherapy. In this study, only the patients who received chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab were included in the analyses.Tumor tissue was obtained by ultrasound guided 14- or 16-gauge needle biopsy prior to treatment and after 12 weeks of treatment. The third biopsy was taken at the time of surgery (week 25). Surgery was performed four weeks after administration of the last dose of bevacizumab. Biopsies from all three time points were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C. If possible, peripheral blood was also obtained at all three time points.Patients were classified as having pathological complete response (pCR) or non-pCR. Pathological complete response was obtained if there were no tumor cells detected in the surgery specimen, nor lymph nodes. Shrinkage of the tumor was measured and a continuous response ratio was calculated as the tumor size at surgery divided by tumor size at diagnosis. The tumor size before treatment start and at 12 weeks were measured by MRI, ultrasound or mammography. MRI was measurements were used for tumor classification and for the evaluations performed in the majority of patients. In 22 patients, MRI was not available, and the largest measured diameter of either ultrasound or mammography was used. Patients were categorized as having good, intermediate or no response (GR, IR, NR) based on percentage shrinkage (0-10%, 10-90% or more than 90% of the tumor left, respectively).Patients treated only with chemotherapy were classified as belonging to the Chemotherapy-arm, while patients treated with combination of chemotherapy and bevacizumab were classified within the Combination-arm."

On the other hand, abundant histology slides have been generated to date, yet their uses remain very limited and largely qualitative. Our goal is to develop automated histology analysis as an alternative subtyping technology for ovarian cancer that is cost-efficient and do not rely on DNA quality. We develop an automated system for scoring hematoxylin and eosin-stained (H&amp;E) primary tumour sections of 91 late-stage ovarian cancer to identify single cells including cancer and stromal cells. We demonstrated high accuracy of our system based on expert pathologists’ scores (cancer=97.1%, stromal=89.1%) as well as compared to immunohistochemistry scoring (correlation=0.87). Quantitative stromal cell ratio is significantly associated with poor overall survival after controlling for clinical parameters including debulking status and age (multivariate analysis p=0.0021, HR=2.54, CI=1.40-4.60) and progression-free survival (multivariate analysis p=0.022, HR=1.75, CI=1.09–2.82).  We demonstrate how automated image analysis enables objective quantification of microenvironmental composition of ovarian tumours. Our analysis reveals a strong effect of the tumour microenvironment on ovarian cancer progression and highlights the potential of therapeutic interventions that target the stromal compartment or cancer-stroma signalling in the stroma-high, late-stage ovarian cancer subset."

However, knowledge about variation in gene expression in normal breast tissue has not been widely explored. Surrogates for normal breast tissue vary between studies making comparisons between them difficult. There is a need to describe gene expression in normal breast tissue and its normal variation, establishing robust base line for further studies.Matherial and Methods:Using microarray technology, we analyzed a large (n=311), representative sample of breast biopsies from healthy postmenopausal women in the Norwegian Woman and Cancer study (NOWAC). We investigated gene expression variability following frequent exposures such as smoking, HRT and alcohol consumption in non-experimental conditions.Results:We observed that the overall gene expression level in normal breast tissue is low and not strongly influenced by exposure to HRT, alcohol or smoking. However, pathway analyses revealed enrichment of different gene sets between exposed and non-exposed groups indicating that these exposures are reflected in normal breast tissue. On the single gene level, Cytochrome P450 (CYP1B1) showed significant up-regulation with a fold-change of 1.36 and p&lt;0.05 in smokers."

Resident hepatic mesenchymal cells, which are the major source of scar deposition during liver fibrogenesis, have long been regarded as a functionally homogeneous population following liver injury. However, using a single cell RNAseq approach (SmartSeq2 protocol) in mouse models of hepatic fibrosis, we have found that the hepatic mesenchyme is comprised of multiple different cellular subpopulations, with highly variable pro-fibrotic phenotypes.
In this project we will use a droplet-based, high throughput single cell sequencing platform (10X Genomics) to interrogate the transcriptomes of thousands of mesenchymal cells from mouse models of liver fibrosis and also from normal and cirrhotic human livers. Critically, this high throughput approach will allow the identification of the key profibrogenic subpopulations driving human liver fibrosis with a very high degree of resolution, and will allow the identification of new, rational anti-fibrotic targets to treat patients with chronic liver disease. This project brings together Prof Ponting’s expertise in cutting-edge single cell bioinformatics approaches, and Prof Henderson’s expertise in the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating liver fibrosis."

As prostate tumours progress locally they frequently invade the periprostatic adipose compartment, gaining access to locally produced adipokines that have been associated with tumour cell growth, invasion and metastases. In this study we investigate the adipose transcriptional profiles of high-risk and low-risk disease to determine both prognostic potential and possible biological drivers of aggressive disease.Experimental Design: RNA was extracted from periprostatic and subcutaneous adipose tissue taken from patients categorised as having prostate cancer with either a high- or low-risk of progression by the D’Amico classification system and profiled by gene-expression microarray.Results: A clear separation was observed between the transcriptional profiles of high-risk and low-risk prostate cancer in periprostatic adipose tissue and a 10-gene signature consisting of CXORF39, PTGR1, CTNNA1, CDK8, TMEM64, LAMP3, LMO3, RGS16, SVEP1, and MEF2A, was able to separate high- and low-risk disease. Furthermore, similarities observed between periprostatic and subcutaneous adipose tissues may indicate a systemic contribution of adipose tissue to prostate cancer.Conclusions: Periprostatic adipose tissue is contributing to the tumour microenvironment of prostate cancer and affecting the progression of the disease."

EGAS00001001766, genomic history  aboriginal australia,"The population history of Aboriginal Australians remains largely uncharacterised. We generated high-coverage genomes for 83 Aboriginal Australians (speakers of Pama-Nyungan languages) and 25 Papuans from the New Guinea Highlands. We find that Papuan and Aboriginal Australian ancestors diversified 25-40 thousand years ago (kya), suggesting early population structure in the ancient continent of Sahul (Australia, New Guinea and Tasmania). However, all studied Aboriginal Australians descend from a single founding population that differentiated ~10-32 kya. We infer a population expansion in northeast Australia during the Holocene (past c.10 kya) associated with limited gene flow from this region to the rest of Australia consistent with the spread of the Pama-Nyungan languages. We estimate that Aboriginal Australians and Papuans diverged from Eurasians 51-72 kya, following a single out of Africa dispersal, and subsequently admixed with different archaic populations. Finally, we report evidence of selection in Aboriginal Australians potentially associated with living in the desert."
EGAS00001003228,genomic landscape  oral cancers illumina wgs,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a necessary but insufficient cause of a subset of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) that is increasing markedly in frequency. To identify contributory, secondary genetic alterations in these cancers, we used comprehensive genomics methods to compare 149 HPV-positive and 335 HPV-negative OSCC tumor/normal pairs. Different behavioral risk factors underlying the two OSCC types were reflected in distinctive genomic mutational signatures. In HPV-positive OSCC, the signatures of APOBEC cytosine deaminase editing, associated with anti-viral immunity, were strongly linked to overall mutational burden. By contrast, in HPV-negative OSCC, T&gt;C substitutions in the sequence context 5’-ATN-3’ correlated with tobacco exposure. Universal expression of HPV E6*1 and E7 oncogenes was a sine qua non of HPV-positive OSCC. Significant enrichment of somatic mutations was confirmed or newly identified in PIK3CA, KMT2D, FGFR3, FBXW7, DDX3X, PTEN, TRAF3, RB1, CYLD, RIPK4, ZNF750, EP300, CASZ1, TAF5, RBL1, IFNGR1 and NFKBIA. Of these, many affect host pathways already targeted by HPV oncoproteins, including the p53 and pRB pathways, or disrupt host defenses against viral infections, including interferon and nuclear factor-B signaling. Frequent copy number changes were associated with concordant changes in gene expression. Chr. 11q (including CCND1) and 14q (including DICER1 and AKT1) were recurrently lost in HPV-positive OSCC, in contrast to their gains in HPV-negative OSCC. High-ranking variant allele fractions implicated ZNF750, PIK3CA and EP300 mutations as candidate driver events in HPV-positive cancers. We conclude that virus-host interactions cooperatively shape the unique genetic features of these cancers, distinguishing them from their HPV-negative counterparts."

By re-sequencing 1.29 Mb of 9p21 region and scrutinizing DNase-seq data from the ENCODE project, we prioritized rs17761446 as a candidate functional variant that was in perfect linkage disequilibrium with the original GWAS SNP (rs10965235) and located on DNase I hypersensitive site. Chromosome conformation capture followed by high-throughput sequencing revealed that the protective G allele of rs17761446 exerted stronger chromatin interaction with ANRIL promoter. We demonstrated that the protective allele exhibited preferential binding affinities to TCF7L2 and EP300 by bioinformatics and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses. ChIP assays for histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation and RNA polymerase II reinforced the enhancer activity of the SNP site. The allele specific expression analysis for eutopic endometrial tissues and endometrial carcinoma cell lines showed that rs17761446 was a cis-regulatory variant where G allele was associated with increased ANRIL expression."

The enormous T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, required for recognising foreign and self-antigens2,3, could serve as lineage tags to track these T cells in tumours4. Here, we obtained transcriptomes of 11,138 single T cells from 12 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and developed STARTRAC (Single T-cell Analysis by Rna-seq and Tcr TRACking) indices to quantitatively analyse dynamic relationships among 20 identified T cell subsets with distinct functions and clonalities. While both CD8+ effector and “exhausted” T cells exhibited high clonal expansion, they were independently connected with tumour-resident CD8+ effector memory cells, implicating a TCR-based fate decision. Of the CD4+ T cells, the majority of tumour-infiltrating Tregs showed clonal exclusivity, whereas certain Treg clones were developmentally linked to multiple TH clones. Notably, we identified two IFNG+ TH1-like clusters in tumours, the GZMK+ TEM and CXCL13+ TH1-like clusters, which were associated with distinct IFN-γ-regulating transcription factors, EOMES/RUNX3 and BHLHE40, respectively. Only CXCL13+BHLHE40+ TH1-like cells were preferentially enriched in tumours of microsatellite-instable (MSI) patients, which might explain their favourable response rates to immune-checkpoint blockade. Furthermore, we found IGFLR1 to be highly expressed in both CXCL13+BHLHE40+ TH1-like and CD8+ exhausted T cells and possessed co-stimulatory functions. Our integrated STARTRAC analyses provides a powerful avenue to comprehensively dissect the T cell properties in CRC, which could shed new insights into the dynamic relationships of T cells in other cancers"

A pilot study of 22 T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) detected not only all known activating non-coding variants, but also a novel recurrent variant predicted to activate the TAL1 oncogene by forming a new enhancer, a finding validated in vivo by ChIP-seq of a patient-derived xenograft (PDX). Furthermore, we discovered two novel T-ALL genes, LMO3 and PRLR, which were cis-activated by a novel intergenic SV and a focal deletion, respectively.

EGAS00001001720,multi region ultra deep sequencing reveals early inter mixing  variable levels  intratumoral heterogeneity  colorectal cancer,"Background: Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) contributes to cancer progression and chemoresistance. We sought to comprehensively describe ITH of somatic mutations, copy number and transcriptomic alterations involving clinically and biologically relevant genes pathways in colorectal cancer (CRC). 
Methods: We performed multi-region, high-depth (384x on average) sequencing of 799 cancer-associated genes in 24 spatially separated primary tumor and non-malignant tissues from 4 treatment-naïve CRC patients. We then used ultra-deep sequencing (17,075x on average) to accurately verify presence or absence of identified somatic mutations in each sector. We also digitally measured gene expression and copy number alterations using NanoString assays. We identified subclonal point mutations and determined the mutational timing and phylogenetic relationships among spatially separated sectors of each tumor.
Results: Truncal mutations, those shared by all sectors in the tumor, affected well described driver genes such as APC, TP53, and KRAS. With sequencing at 17,075x, we found that mutations first detected at a sequencing depth of 384x were in fact more widely shared among sectors than originally assessed. Interestingly, ultra-deep sequencing also revealed some mutations that were present in all spatially dispersed sectors, but at subclonal levels. 
Conclusions: Ultra-high depth validation sequencing, copy number analysis, and gene expression profiling provided a comprehensive and accurate genomic landscape of spatial heterogeneity in CRC. Ultra-deep sequencing allowed more sensitive detection of somatic mutations and a more accurate assessment of ITH. By detecting subclonal mutations with ultra-deep sequencing, we traced the genomic histories of each tumor and relative timing of mutational events. We found evidence of early mixing, in which subclonal ancestral mutations inter-mixed across sectors before the acquisition of subsequent non-truncal mutations. Our findings also indicate that different CRC patients display markedly variable ITH, suggesting that each patient’s tumor possess a unique genomic history and spatial organization."

Relapse-specific somatic alterations were significantly enriched in 12 genes (NR3C1/2, TP53, NT5C2, FPGS, CREBBP, MSH2/6, PMS2, WHSC1, and PRPS1/2) predominantly involved in drug response. The prevalence was 25%, 72% and 50% in very-early relapses (&lt;9 months from diagnosis), early (9-36 months) and late relapse (&gt;36 months), respectively. Two novel, relapse-specific mutational signatures likely gave rise to drug-resistant mutations, including NT5C2, PRPS1, and TP53 variants. Selective sweep and multi-lineage recurrence accounted for 53% and 26% of the relapses, respectively. Clonal composition evolved in response to chemotherapy including sequential acquisition of multiple resistance mutations.

DUP4 is a complex structural genomic variant that carries extra copies of a glycophorin A - glycophorin B fusion gene, and has a dramatic effect on malaria risk by reducing the risk of severe malaria by up to 40% Using fiber-FISH and Illumina sequencing, we validate the structural arrangement of the glycophorin locus in the DUP4 variant, and reveal somatic variation in copy number of the glycophorin A- glycophorin B fusion gene. By developing a simple, specific, PCR-based assay for DUP4 we show the DUP4 variant reaches a frequency of 13% in a malaria-endemic village in south-eastern Tanzania. We genotype a substantial proportion of that village and demonstrate an association of DUP4 genotype with hemoglobin levels, a phenotype related to malaria, using a family-based association test. Taken together, we show that DUP4 is a complex structural variant that may be susceptible to somatic variation, and show that it is associated with a malarial-related phenotype in a non-hospitalizedlongitudinally-followed population."

This weakness can be exploited in the clinic using an approach called ‘evolutionary herding’ that aims at controlling the tumour cell population to delay or prevent resistance. However, model systems able to recapitulate cancer evolution experimentally are lacking and current in vitro techniques based on small populations, re-plating and escalating dose, are unsuitable to develop evolutionary herding strategies. We present a novel methodology for evolutionary herding in vitro and ex vivo using patient-derived organoids. Our approach is based on a combination of single-cell barcoding, very large populations of 108-109 cells grown without re-plating, realistic high drug doses, time-course monitoring of cancer clones, and mathematical modelling of tumour evolutionary dynamics. We demonstrate evolutionary herding in non-small cell lung cancer in vitro and in patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids (PDO). We show that herding causes controlled evolutionary bottlenecks that lead to collateral sensitivity. Through genomic analysis, we were also able to determine the mechanisms that drive such sensitivity. Our approach allows modelling evolutionary trade-offs experimentally to test patient-specific evolutionary herding strategies that can be translated into the clinic to control treatment resistance."

Here, we present a draft genome assembly of D. zibethinus—the third plant genus in the Malvales order and the first in its Helicteroideae subfamily. Comparative phylogenomics suggests a recent paleopolyploidy event in the durian lineage, distinct from whole-genome duplications described for cotton, another Malvales member. Transcriptomic comparisons between different durian plant organs, and across fruits from different evolutionary lineages, revealed upregulation of sulfur, ethylene, and lipid-related pathways in durian fruits, consistent with the latter’s striking phenotypic traits. Similar comparisons between distinct durian fruit cultivars (Musang King, Monthong, Puyat) also yielded molecular rationales for within-cultivar differences in smell and taste. We identified, within the durian lineage, specific gene family expansions in sulfur processing and in particular the MGL gene, which catalyzes production of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). Both MGL and the ethylene-related gene ACS are upregulated in durian fruits, suggesting that VSC production and ripening may be coupled by the Yang cycle, a biosynthetic pathway linking ethylene biosynthesis to methionine regeneration.

Here, we identify frequent TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 mutations in human vemurafenib-induced skin lesions and in sporadic cSCC. Functional analysis reveals these mutations ablate canonical TGFβ Smad signaling which is localised to bulge stem cells in both normal human and murine skin. MAPK pathway hyperactivation (through BrafV600E or KrasG12D knockin) and TGFβ signaling ablation (through Tgfbr1 deletion) in LGR5+ve stem cells enables rapid cSCC development in the mouse. Mutation of Tp53 (which is commonly mutated in sporadic cSCC) coupled with Tgfbr1 deletion in LGR5+ve cells also results in cSCC development. These findings indicate that LGR5+ve stem cells can act as cells of origin for cSCC and that RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway hyperactivation or Tp53 mutation, coupled with loss of TGFβ signaling, are driving events of skin tumorigenesis."

We show that SCLC patients (37/38) have rare CTC subpopulations co-expressing Vascular Endothelial-Cadherin (VE-Cadherin) and cytokeratins consistent with vasculogenic mimicry (VM), a process whereby tumour cells form ‘endothelial like’ vessels. Single cell genomic analysis reveals characteristic SCLC genomic changes in both VE-Cadherin positive and negative CTCs. Higher levels of VM are associated with worse overall survival in 41 limited stage patients’ biopsies (p&lt;0.025). VM vessels are also observed in 9/10 CTC patient-derived explants (CDX), where molecular analysis of fractionated VE-Cadherin positive cells uncovered copy number alterations and mutated TP53, confirming human tumour origin. VE-Cadherin is required for VM in NCI-H446 SCLC xenografts, where VM decreases tumour latency and, despite increased cisplatin intra-tumour delivery, decreases cisplatin efficacy.

Here, we show that the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be used to efficiently complement existing GEMMs of sarcoma and generate primary sarcomas in wild-type mice. Mice with the genotype KrasLSL-G12D/+; Rosa26LSL-Cas9-EGFP/+  received intramuscular delivery of an adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase and a single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting Trp53. Cre-mediated expression of oncogenic Kras and Cas9, in combination with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of Trp53, was sufficient to generate primary soft tissue sarcomas. These tumors arose with kinetics and mutational load similar to those generated using the Cre-loxP system to activate oncogenic Kras and delete Trp53 alleles. Additionally, we injected an adenovirus containing Cas9 and sgRNAs targeting Nf1 and Trp53 into the sciatic nerve of wild-type mice. These mice formed malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) in the same timeframe as MPNSTs generated using the Cre-loxP system to delete Nf1 and Ink4a/Arf alleles in GEMMs. These data demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to generate soft tissue sarcomas in wild-type mice.  Moreover, these results suggest that this technology can complement existing GEMMs for rapid assessment of tumor-modifying genes. These tools should decrease the time and expense associated with employing autochthonous mouse models of sarcoma for preclinical research.

EGAS00001002920,ss18 ssx mediated hijacking  baf complexes drives synovial sarcoma,"Synovial sarcoma (SS) is defined by a recurrent t(x;18) chromosomal translocation, which produces the hallmark SS18-SSX oncogenic fusion. Incorporation of SS18-SSX into BAF complexes renders BAF complexes aberrant in two distinct manners: the addition of 78aa of SSX onto SS18, and concomitant loss of BAF47 assembly. However, the importance and functional contributions of each of these perturbations on BAF complex targeting and gene expression regulation remain unclear. Here we use an integrative set of genomic approaches in human cancer cell lines and primary tumor samples to define the mechanistic consequences of the SS18-SSX fusion oncoprotein. We find that SS18-SSX hijacks BAF complexes to broad polycomb domains to activate bivalent genes, driving a unique gene expression program distinct from other loss-of-function BAF complex malignancies. Importantly, restoration of BAF47 rescues enhancer activation but is dispensable for proliferative arrest in cell lines. These results demonstrate that gain-of-function SS18-SSX-mediated BAF complex targeting and gene activation is the driving event in SS, and present a mechanism by which distinct functions of BAF complexes can be co-opted to drive oncogenesis."

One of these carried a hepatitis B transgene, designed to model the effect of hepatitis B infection, which synergizes with aflatoxin in human HCC risk. The cell-line mutational patterns were remarkably stable across replicates. Mutational patterns in the mouse tumors were more variable across replicates, apparently reflecting activation of additional mutagenic processes during tumorigenesis. However, the overall pattern was consistently dominated by G &gt; T mutations with a preference for TGC &gt; TTC mutations, and it exhibited substantial mutation enrichment on the non-transcribed strand. We integrated these experimental results with newly generated genomic HCC data from a geographical region of known aflatoxin exposure and with additional, publicly available human HCC data. Like the experimental systems, the human HCCs showed high rates of G &gt; T mutations and strong transcriptional strand bias, providing evidence that the HCCs were direct consequences of AFB1 exposure. The experimental data supported previous in-silico analysis that proposed a connection on epidemiological grounds between aflatoxin exposure and COSMIC mutational signature 24. However, the HCCs differed slightly from the experimental systems in that the most frequent mutations were GGC &gt; GTC. This difference might have been due to exposure to other aflatoxins, to other mutagens, or the short-term, high-dose exposure in the experimental systems compared to chronic, lower-dose exposure in HCCs. This illustrates subtleties that can arise in linking experimental mutation patterns to those in tumors."

Since the effect of these loci in the general population is unknown, we aimed toinvestigate the effect on electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters and outcomes in the general population.Material and Methods: A cohort of 6,161 individuals (median age 45 [interquartile range (IQR) 40-50] years, 49% males), withavailable digital ECGs, was genotyped and subsequently followed for a median period of 13 [IQR 12.6-13.4] years. Data on outcomeswere collected from Danish administrative healthcare registries. Furthermore, ~400.000 persons from UK Biobank wereinvestigated for associations between the three loci and cardiac arrest/ventricular fibrillation (VF).Results: Homozygote carriers of the C allele in rs6800541 intronic to SCN10A had a significantly larger J-point elevation (JPE)compared with wildtype carriers (11 V vs 6 V, P&lt;0.001). There was an additive effect of carrying multiple BrS-associated riskalleles with an increased JPE in lead V1. None of the BrS‐associated genetic loci predisposed to syncope, atrial fibrillation, or totalmortality in the general population of Denmark.

Underlying this evolution are disruptions of critical biological processes, the status of which is reflected by changes at the DNA, RNA and protein level. Screening, i.e. early detection and removal of lesions, is the best approach to decrease the high number of CRC deaths. Most countries applying programmatic CRC screening have selected a hemoglobin-based stool test, the Fecal immunochemical Test (FIT). Furthermore, combining molecular markers with FIT in stool based secondary prevention tests can improve the diagnostic yield. However, the optimal set of molecular markers to implement in population based programmatic screening remains to be determined. The present study sets out to identify miRNAs that can be used to discriminate stool samples from CRC patients, patients with adenomas and control individuals. In this study, differences in miRNA expression levels were first determined in 30 CRC and 30 adenoma tissues by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Subsequent validation was performed on 55 independent CRC and 73 adenomas tissue samples by RT-qPCR. The performance of the identified miRNAs as potential biomarkers in stool samples was assessed by RT-qPCR in 430 stool samples (from 213 CRC, 53 advanced adenoma, and 55 non-advanced adenoma patients and 109 controls)."

While most patients experience tonsillitis only rarely, a subset of patients suffer from recurrent or chronic tonsillitis or pharyngitis. The predisposing factors for recurring or chronic form of this disease are not yet fully understood but genetic predisposition has been suggested. A genetic association study using Illumina’s Immunochip SNP array was performed to search for new genetic biomarkers in pharyngeal tonsillitis. Over 100,000 SNPs relevant to immune-mediated diseases were analyzed in a cohort of 95 patients subjected to tonsillectomy due to recurrent/chronic tonsillitis and 504 controls. Genetic association between the cases and controls showed strongest association with two peaks in the HLA locus (OR 3.7-4.7, p=4.9-5.7x10-6). Further analysis with imputed classical HLA alleles suggested the known psoriasis risk allele HLA-C*06:02 as a risk factor for tonsillitis (p=4.8 x 10-4, OR 2.3). In addition, the imputed HLA haplotype HLA-C*06:02/HLA-B*5701, a reported risk haplotype in psoriasis, had the strongest risk for tonsillitis, too (p=8.0 x 10-3, OR 5.5). These findings further support the previously reported link between streptococcal throat infections and psoriasis."

We performed whole exome sequencing, copy number variation and/or RNA-Seq for 65 patients to discover mutations at diagnosis and blast crisis (BC). Forty-six chronic phase patients with the extremes of outcome were studied at diagnosis. Cancer gene variants were detected in 15/27 patients (56%) with subsequent BC or poor outcome and in 3/19 optimal responders (16%), P=.007. Frequently mutated genes at diagnosis were ASXL1, IKZF1 and RUNX1. The methyltransferase SETD1B was a novel recurrently mutated gene. A novel class of variant associated with the Philadelphia translocation was detected at diagnosis in 11/46 patients (24%) comprising fusions and/or rearrangement of genes on the translocated chromosomes, with evidence of fragmentation, inversion and imperfect sequence reassembly. These were more frequent at diagnosis in patients with poor outcome: 9/27 (33%) versus 2/19 optimal responders (11%), P=.07. Thirty-nine patients were tested at BC and all had cancer gene variants, including ABL1 kinase domain mutations in 58%. However, ABL1 mutations co-occurred with other mutated cancer genes in 89% of cases, and these predated ABL1 mutations in 62% of evaluable patients. Gene fusions not associated with the Philadelphia translocation occurred in 42% of patients at BC and commonly involved fusion partners that were known cancer genes (78%). Genomic analysis revealed numerous relevant variants at diagnosis in patients with poor outcome and all patients at BC. Future refined biomarker testing of specific variants will likely provide prognostic information to facilitate a risk-adapted therapeutic approach."

Using whole exome sequencing, we found that 26% of a cohort of 23 subjects with OMD harboured the same homozygous nonsense pathogenic mutation in PATL2, a gene encoding a putative RNA-binding protein. Using Patl2 knockout mice, we confirmed that PATL2 deficiency disturbs oocyte maturation, since oocytes and zygotes exhibit morphological and developmental defects respectively. PATL2's amphibian orthologue is involved in the regulation of oocyte mRNA as a partner of CPEB. However, Patl2's expression profile throughout oocyte development in mice, alongside colocalisation experiments with Cpeb1, Msy2 and Ddx6 (three oocyte RNA-regulators) suggest an original role for Patl2 in Mammals. Accordingly, transcriptomic analysis of oocytes from WT and Patl2-/- animals demonstrated that in the absence of Patl2, expression levels of a select number of highly relevant genes involved in oocyte maturation and early embryonic development are deregulated. In conclusion, PATL2 is a novel actor of mammalian oocyte maturation whose invalidation causes OMD in humans."

The lung microbiome of these patients will be analysed in parallel by deep sequencing and 16S sequencing. These data will provide important information to the development of strategies aimed at improving patient outcomes, reducing the development of antimicrobial resistance and facilitating infection control measures in hospital.
Specifically, the proposed work will be a proof of principle study of 100 patients. We will use transcriptomic data to define the host contribution to the symptoms of these critically ill patients diagnosed with pneumonia. The data will be correlated with cytokine/chemokine concentrations, routine microbiology analysis and pathogen genomic data from the same samples to determine the ecology of the lungs of these patients. We will look for associations between clinical features, host response and pathogen genomics in order to identify new diagnostic markers. This study should provide important information to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis - resulting in more targeted and successful treatment of critically ill patients in the ICU.

EGAS00001003097,identification  targets   induce  tolerogenic function  dendritic cells   treatment  immune mediated disease,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are key regulators of immune responses. DCs capture and process antigenic proteins, and present peptides from these proteins to T cells expressing antigen-specific T cell receptors. DCs also modulate the nature of the response generated through the expression of a range of cell-associated and secreted molecules. On this basis, DCs play a major role in driving the generation of polarised effector T cells subsets, such as Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells. Conversely, ‘tolerogenic’ DCs are thought to be involved in maintaining immunological tolerance via the induction of T cell unresponsiveness or apoptosis and the generation of regulatory T cells. The considerable therapeutic potential of these cells has led to a number of ongoing clinical trials transferring in vitro derived tolerogenic DCs into patients with autoimmune diseases. Hence, there is much interest in the therapeutic potential of modulating the function of DCs, including reducing the ability of these cells to activate T cells and pushing them towards a tolerogenic phenotype, in the fields of allergy, autoimmune diseases and transplant tolerance. We propose to screen for targets regulating DC phenotypes, including the tolerogenic phenotype.

We find a common Bantu and Austronesian descent for all Malagasy individuals with a limited paternal contribution from Europe and the Middle East. Admixture and demographic growth happened recently, suggesting a rapid settlement of Madagascar during the last millennium. However, the distribution of African and Asian ancestry across the island reveals that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, suggesting independent colonization of Madagascar from Africa and Asia rather than settlement by an already-admixed population. In addition, there are geographic influences on the present genomic diversity, independent of the admixture, showing that a few centuries is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations."

Understanding this genetic variation can provide insights into the evolutionary processes that shape both human adaptation and variation in disease. Populations from SSA have the highest levels of genetic diversity. This characteristic, in addition to historical genetic admixture, can lead to complexities in the design of studies assessing the genetic determinants of disease and human variation. However, such studies of African populations are also likely to provide new opportunities to discover novel disease susceptibility loci and variants and refine gene–disease association signals. A systematic assessment of genetic diversity within SSA would facilitate genomic epidemiological studies in the region. The Genome Diversity in Africa Project (GDAP) aims to produce a comprehensive catalogue of human genetic variation in SSA, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), structural variants, and haplotypes. This resource will make a substantial contribution to understanding patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations in SSA, as well as providing a global resource to help design, implement and interpret genomic studies in SSA populations and studies comprising globally diverse populations, complementing existing genomic resources. Specifically, we plan to carry out high depth whole genome sequencing of up to 2000 individuals across Africa (25 individuals from each ethnolinguistic group). Our scientific objectives are to: 1) develop a resource that provides a comprehensive catalogue of genetic variation in populations from SSA accessible to the global scientific community; 2) characterise population genetic diversity, structure, gene flow and admixture across SSA; 3) develop a cost-efficient, next-generation genotype array for diverse populations across SSA; and 4) facilitate whole genome-sequencing association studies of complex traits and diseases by developing a reference panel for imputation and resource for enhancing fine-mapping disease susceptibility loci. These scientific objectives will be supported by cross-cutting operational activities, including network and management of the consortium, research ethics, and research capacity building in statistical genetics and bioinformatics.

Currently, genetic profiles in familial MDS/AML are considered analogous to sporadic disease, although the patterns of clonal evolution within families are poorly defined.  We performed whole exome profiling of tumour samples from a novel RUNX1 mutated family, to determine the stepwise evolution of MDS/AML across 4 young siblings.  Three siblings developed monocytic AML/RAEB2 at 5 years of age, with hepatosplenomegaly and somatic mutations upregulating JAK-STAT signalling, the latter are typically detected in &lt;5% of sporadic MDS/AML.  Two siblings acquired the canonical JAK2 V617F mutation, while another acquired a unique missense mutation of SH2B3, a negative regulator of JAK2.  Notably, 2/3 siblings demonstrated dosage amplification of these mutations due to acquired uniparental disomy of chromosomes 9p and 12q (encompassing JAK2 and SH2B3, respectively).  All 4 siblings were heterozygous for the 46/1 JAK2 haplotype associated with predisposition to sporadic V617F myeloproliferative disorders, which likely influenced the acquisition of JAK2 mutations.

However, the origin of their proliferative heterogeneity during tumour growth pre- and post-treatment remains poorly understood. Here we study the clonal evolution of DNA barcoded [4-6] GBMs following their serial propagation in xenograft mouse models to define the fate behaviour of individual GBM cells. Through quantitative analysis of clone sizes scored across multiple passages, we show that the growth of GBM clones in vivo is consistent with a remarkably neutral process resulting from a conserved proliferative hierarchy. In this model, slow-cycling stem-like cells give rise to a more rapidly cycling progenitor population with extensive self-maintenance capacity, that in turn generates short-lived cells that lack proliferative ability. We also identify rare “outlier” clones that deviate from these dynamics, and further show that chemotherapy reproducibly facilitates the selective expansion of pre-existing drug-resistant GBM lineages. Finally, we show that coexisting, functionally distinct GSCs may be targeted separately with epigenetic compounds. These findings suggest that, independent of an evolving mutational signature [7, 8], the clonal dynamics of human GBM can be surprisingly robust, with intratumoural heterogeneity derived primarily from the defined stochastic fate behaviour of tumour cells within a conserved proliferative hierarchy."

Whole-genome sequencing (30X) was performed on 3,006 5+ year survivors of childhood cancer (median age, 35.8 [range: 7.1-69.8] years) from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort. Survivors underwent a comprehensive clinical assessment. Germline mutations in 156 cancer predisposition genes (SJCPG156), including a subset of 60 (SJCPG60) autosomal dominant genes with moderate to high penetrance, were classified for their pathogenicity. Piecewise exponential regression, stratified by radiation exposure, was used to evaluate the relative rate (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of SN occurrence by mutation status. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations in SJCPG156 and SJCPG60 were identified in 11.7% and 5.8% of survivors, respectively. The most frequently mutated SJCPG60 genes included RB1 (n=43), NF1 (n=22), BRCA2 (n=14), BRCA1 (n=12) and TP53 (n=10). Mutations in SJCPG60 were associated with the rate of subsequent sarcoma (RR, 10.3; 95% CI, 4.2 to 25.6) and breast cancer (RR, 13.3; 95% CI, 5.8 to 30.5) among irradiated survivors, and the rate of developing any SN (RR, 4.8; 95% CI, 2.4 to 9.4) and breast cancer (RR, 7.8; 95% CI, 2.5 to 24.0) among non-irradiated survivors.

Next, we performed whole genome sequencing for 32 SRCC patients with &gt; 80% signet-ring cells in tumor, and identified frequent5 CLDN18-ARHGAP26/6 fusion (25%). With additional 797 patients for validation, we notice that prevalence of CLDN18-ARHGAP26/6 fusion is positively associated with signet-ring cell content (P = 4.1 x 10 -9 ), younger age at diagnosis (P = 4.2 x 10 -10 ), female/male ratio (P = 1.7 x 10 -9 ), and advanced TNM stage (P = 1.7 x 10 -5 ). Importantly, patients with CLDN18-ARHGAP26/6 fusion had a worse survival outcomes (P = 0.03), and got no benefit0 from platinum/fluoropyrimidines based chemotherapy (P = 0.92) compared to fusion-free patients (P = 0.001), which is consistent with the fact of oxaliplatin/fluoropyrimidine resistance acquired in CLDN18-ARHGAP26 introduced gastric cancer cell lines. Overall, this study provides new insights into the clinical and genomic features of SRCC, and highlights the importance of frequent CLDN18-ARHGAP26/6 fusions in chemotherapy response for SRCC."

EGAS00001002768,genome diversity  africa project,"Globally, human populations show structured genetic diversity as a result of geographical dispersion, selection and drift. Understanding this genetic variation can provide insights into the evolutionary processes that shape both human adaptation and variation in disease. Populations from SSA have the highest levels of genetic diversity. This characteristic, in addition to historical genetic admixture, can lead to complexities in the design of studies assessing the genetic determinants of disease and human variation. However, such studies of African populations are also likely to provide new opportunities to discover novel disease susceptibility loci and variants and refine gene–disease association signals. A systematic assessment of genetic diversity within SSA would facilitate genomic epidemiological studies in the region.
The African Genome Variation Project (AGVP) is an international collaboration that aims to produce a comprehensive catalogue of human genetic variation in SSA. This resource has extended our understanding of population history, patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations in SSA, as well as providing a global resource to help design, implement and interpret genomic studies.
The Genome Diversity in Africa Project (GDAP) will extend and expand the African Genome Variation (AGV) project. Using a sequencing-based approach, GDA project aims to produce a comprehensive catalogue of human genetic variation in SSA, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), structural variants, and haplotypes. This resource will make a substantial contribution to understanding patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations in SSA, as well as providing a global resource to help design, implement and interpret genomic studies in SSA populations and studies comprising globally diverse populations, complementing existing genomic resources. Specifically, we plan to carry out low coverage (4x) whole genome sequencing of up to 2000 individuals across Africa (100 individuals from each ethnolinguistic group), and complement these data with 2.5M Illumina genotyping. We have already completed sequencing of 700 individuals across SSA, we are now adding an additional 500 samples from up to 5 ethno-linguistic groups within Africa, including populations from Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Morocco, Ghana and Seychelles.
Our scientific objectives are to: 1) develop a resource that provides a comprehensive catalogue of genetic variation in populations from SSA accessible to the global scientific community; 2) characterise population genetic diversity, structure, gene flow and admixture across SSA; 3) develop a cost-efficient, next-generation genotype array for diverse populations across SSA; and 4) facilitate whole genome-sequencing association studies of complex traits and diseases by developing a reference panel for imputation and resource for enhancing fine-mapping disease susceptibility loci. These scientific objectives will be supported by cross-cutting operational activities, including network and management of the consortium, research ethics, and research capacity building in statistical genetics and bioinformatics."

P7731 was analyzed for DNA copy number variation, somatic mutations and gene expression and compared to the primary tumor. Results: P7731 cells are negative for estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 (triple-negative), strongly express vimentin (100% of cells positive) and also express cytokeratins 8/18 and 19 but at lower frequencies. Flow cytometry indicates P7731 cells are predominantly CD44+/CD49f+/EpCAM-, consistent with a primitive, mesenchymal-like phenotype. The cell line is tumorigenic in immunocompromised mice. Exome sequencing identified a total of 45 and 76 somatic mutations in the primary tumor and cell line respectively, of which 32 were identified in both samples and included mutations in known driver genes PIK3CA, TP53 and ARID1A. P7731 retains the DNA copy number alterations present in the matching primary tumor. Homozygous deletions detected in the cell line and in the primary tumor were found in regions containing three known (CDKN2A, CDKN2B and CDKN1B) and 23 putative tumor suppressor genes. Cell line specific gene amplification coupled with mRNA expression analysis revealed genes and pathways with potential pro-metastatic functions.Conclusion: This novel human breast cancer-bone metastasis cell line will be a useful model to study aspects of breast cancer biology, particularly metastasis-related changes from breast to bone."

About 20% of the blood DNA sequencing reads matched the tumor DNA reads at the SMARCB1 gene locus. Circulating, tumor-specific DNA aberrations are a promising biomarker for atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor patients.

EGAS00001000376,genomic pathology  sle associated copy number variation   fcgr2c 3b 2b locus,"Reduced FCGR3B copy number is associated with increased risk of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The five FCGR2/3 genes are arranged across two highly paralogous genomic segments on chromosome 1q23. Previous studies have suggested mechanisms for structural rearrangements at the FCGR2/3 locus and have proposed mechanisms whereby altered FCGR3B copy number predisposes to autoimmunity, but the high degree of sequence similarity between paralogous genes and segments has prevented precise definition of the molecular events and their functional consequences. To pursue the genomic pathology associated with FCGR3B copy number variation (CNV), we integrated sequencing data from fosmid and BAC clones and sequence-captured DNA from FCGR3B-deleted genomes to establish a detailed map of allelic and paralogous sequence variation across the FCGR2/3 locus. This analysis identified two highly paralogous 24.5kb blocks within the FCGR2C/FCGR3B/FCGR2B locus that are devoid of non-polymorphic paralogous sequence variations (PSVs) and that define the limits of the genomic regions in which non-allelic homologous recombination leads to FCGR2C/3B CNV. Further, the data showed evidence of swapping of haplotype blocks between these highly paralogous blocks that most likely has arisen from sequential ancestral recombination events across the region. Functionally, we found by flow cytometry, western blotting and cDNA sequencing that individuals with FCGR3B-deleted alleles show ectopic expression of Fc-gamma RIIb on natural killer cells. We conclude that FCGR3B deletion juxtaposes the 5´-regulatory sequences of FCGR2C with the coding sequence of FCGR2B, creating a chimeric gene from which Fc-gamma RIIb is expressed ectopically on NK cells and provides a new explanation for SLE risk associated with reduced FCGR3B gene copy number."

Application of this protocol to human hematopoietic stem cells provided quantitative DNA methylation measurements of up to 5.7 million CpGs in a single cell. Analysis of cis CpG methylation states in single cells revealed a loss of concordance beyond 2kb, which supported the development of a new analytical framework (PDclust) for single-cell DNA methylation datasets that considers heterogeneity of methylation states at single CpG resolution.

EGAS00001003149,single cell analysis  neutrophils,"Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cells and fulfil a critical function in the human immune system.  Their effector functions comprise the phagocytosis of bacteria, the release of antimicrobial agents by degranulation, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Despite of their function of trapping and killing bacteria, NETs seem to play a role in the development of autoimmune diseases. The insufficient clearance of NETs as it occurs for example in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) could contribute the hallmarks of this disease: the production auf autoantibodies and a type I interferon signature. 
Although neutrophils are produced with a high rate of 5x1010 cells/ day and play an important role in the immune defense, they are poorly studied. Their terminal differentiation status and their short life span (6-8h in circulation) make genetic manipulation very difficult. Despite experimental evidence showing that not all neutrophils react to stimulations the same way, no neutrophil subpopulations are described yet. In order to address this important question we will perform single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of Neutrophils at the Sanger Institute.

Prognosis is strongly associated with molecular subgroup, although the driver mutations that distinguish the two main subgroups remain poorly defined. Through an integrative analysis of whole genomes, exomes, and transcriptomes, we have uncovered genes and non-coding loci that are commonly mutated in DLBCL. Our analysis has identified novel cis-regulatory sites, and implicates recurrent mutations in the 3'UTR of NFKBIZ as a novel mechanism of oncogene deregulation and NFκB pathway activation in the activated B-cell (ABC) subgroup. Small amplifications associated with over-expression of FCGR2B (the Fcγ receptor  protein  IIB),  primarily  in  the  germinal  centre  B-cell  (GCB)  subgroup,  correlate with poor patient outcomes suggestive of a novel oncogene.

EGAS00001002484,rrbs sequencing  7 tumour regions   normal sample   single tracerx patient,"Background: Epigenetic heterogeneity within a tumour can play an important role in tumour evolution and the emergence of resistance to treatment. It is increasingly recognised that the study of DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns along the genome - so-called `epialleles' - offers greater insight into epigenetic dynamics than conventional analyses which examine DNAm marks individually. Results: We have developed a Bayesian model to infer which epialleles are present in multiple regions of the same tumour. We apply our method to reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data from multiple regions of one lung cancer tumour and a matched normal sample. The model borrows information from all tumour regions to leverage greater statistical power. The total number of epialleles, the epiallele DNAm patterns, and a noise hyperparameter are all automatically inferred from the data. Uncertainty as to which epiallele an observed sequencing read originated from is explicitly incorporated by marginalising over the appropriate posterior densities. The degree to which tumour samples are contaminated with normal tissue can be estimated and corrected for. By tracing the distribution of epialleles throughout the tumour we can infer the phylogenetic history of the tumour, identify epialleles that differ between normal and cancer tissue, and define a measure of global epigenetic disorder. Conclusions: Detection and comparison of epialleles within multiple tumour regions enables phylogenetic analyses, identification of differentially expressed epialleles, and provides a measure of epigenetic heterogeneity."

EGAS00001002335,drugging  catalytically inactive state  ret kinase  ret rearranged tumors,"Oncogenic fusion events have been identified in a broad range of tumors. Among them, RET rearrangements represent distinct and potentially druggable targets that are recurrently found in lung adenocarcinomas. We provide further evidence that current anti-RET drugs may not be potent enough to induce durable responses in such tumors. We report that potent inhibitors, such as AD80 or ponatinib, that stably bind in the DFG-out conformation of RET may overcome these limitations and selectively kill RET-rearranged tumors. Using chemical genomics in conjunction with phosphoproteomic analyses in RET-rearranged cells, we identify the CCDC6-RETI788N mutation and drug-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway reactivation as possible mechanisms by which tumors may escape the activity of RET inhibitors. Our data provide mechanistic insight into the druggability of RET kinase fusions that may be of help for the development of effective therapies targeting such tumors."

EGAS00001002485,coding  small  coding transcriptional landscape  tuberous sclerosis complex cortical tubers implications  pathophysiology  treatment,"Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a rare genetic disorder that results from a mutation in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes leading to constitutive activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). TSC is associated with autism, intellectual disability and severe epilepsy. Cortical tubers are believed to represent the neuropathological substrates of these disabling manifestations in TSC. In the presented study we used high-throughput RNA sequencing in combination with systems-based computational approaches to investigate the complexity of the TSC molecular network. Overall we detected 438 differentially expressed genes and 991 differentially expressed small non-coding RNAs in cortical tubers compared to autopsy control brain tissue. We observed increased expression of genes associated with inflammatory, innate and adaptive immune responses. In contrast, we observed a down-regulation of genes associated with neurogenesis and glutamate receptor signaling. MicroRNAs represented the largest class of over-expressed small non-coding RNA species in tubers. In particular, our analysis revealed that the miR-34 family  (including miR-34a, miR-34b and miR-34c) was significantly over-expressed. Functional studies demonstrated the ability of miR-34b to modulate neurite outgrowth in mouse primary hippocampal neuronal cultures. This study provides new insights into the TSC transcriptomic network along with the identification of potential new treatment targets."

We compared genomic and clinical features of 159 childhood and adult AEL cases to non-AEL myeloid disorders, and identified patterns of mutation that describe 5 age-related subgroups with distinct transcriptional profiles: adult, TP53-mutated; NPM1-mutated; KMT2A-mutated/rearranged; adult, DDX41-mutated; and pediatric, NUP98-rearranged.  Mutational spectra were age-dependent and significantly associated with outcome, with NPM1 mutations and high HOXB9 expression being associated with favorable prognosis, and TP53, FLT3 and RB1 alterations associated with poor survival. Targetable signaling mutations were present in 45% of cases, and include recurrent mutations of ALK and NTRK1, the latter of which drive erythroid leukemogenesis sensitive to TRK inhibition. This genomic landscape of AEL provides the framework for accurate diagnosis and risk stratification of this disease, and the rationale for testing targeted therapies in this form of leukemia that has hitherto and dismal outcome."

EGAS00001002967,identification  therapeutic targets  rhabdomyosarcoma  integrated genomic epigenomic  proteomic analyses,"Personalized cancer therapy based on the somatic mutations identified in patient tumors is becoming an increasingly emphasized approach to improve outcomes of patients with cancer. There are also examples of therapeutic vulnerabilities in cancer that result from changes in gene expression that are a direct or indirect result of tumor specific epigenetic perturbations. These genomic and epigenomic changes are ultimately manifest in the tumor proteome and phosphoproteome.  In this study, we integrated genomic, epigenomic and proteomic data for rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) to identify therapeutic vulnerabilities. RMS was selected for this analysis because RAS pathway mutations in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) are the most common potentially actionable lesions across pediatric solid tumors. The epigenomic data was useful for identifying deregulated developmental pathways in RMS including the WNT, HH, BMP, adenyl cyclase, p38/MAPK and PI3K pathways. Perturbations in those 6 myogenic signal transduction pathways were also evident in the proteome and phosphoteome data. In addition, the proteomic/phosphoproteomic data revealed that the cell cycle checkpoint, unfolded protein response and RB/E2F pathways were deregulated in RMS relative to normal muscle. Recent success targeting CDK4/6 and MEK in adult cancers with RAS mutations led us to test the value of these targets in RMS tumors. We also targeted the unfolded protein response pathway and cell cycle checkpoint pathway using molecular targeted therapeutics in orthotopic patient derived xenografts. Taken together, these data demonstrate the value of integrating epigenomic and proteomic data to identify tumor vulnerabilities that extend beyond somatic mutations identified in the genome."

EGAS00001003203,hyperhaploid multiple myeloma,"Hyperhaploid multiple myeloma is a rare numerical aberration group defined by a range of 24-34 chromosomes which is associated with a poor prognosis.  Hyperhaploid samples were sequenced by either exome or targeted panel sequencing. Samples had a median of 13 monosomies (range 12-14), which in general were those not associated with trisomies in hyperdiploid samples.  The chromosomes traditionally trisomic in hyperdiploid myeloma were disomic in hyperhaploid myeloma with retention of heterodisomy.  We examined the hyperhaploid samples for frequently mutated genes and found that 9/9 (100%) hyperhaploid samples had a mutation in TP53, exceeding the overall rate of mutation in newly diagnosed patients (5.5%), indicating an oncogenic dependency in this group. All samples with TP53 mutation also had monosomy of chromosome 17, indicating bi-allelic inactivation of TP53.  As such, this high risk group is part of Double-Hit myeloma.

DNA was obtained from either CD138+ cells from the bone marrow of multiple myeloma patients (tumor) or from stem cell harvests from the same patient (control). 100 ng of DNA was fragmented, end-repaired, and adapters ligated using the HyperPlus kit (KAPA Biosystems).  After PCR amplification the libraries were hybridized with probes against either the entire exome (MedExome, Nimblegen) or a targeted panel of 140 genes using SeqCap reagents (Nimblegen).

To understand their evolution, we characterized the double minutes in paired diagnosis and relapse tumors from a pediatric high-grade glioma and four adult glioblastoma patients. We determined the full structures of the major double minutes using a novel approach combining multiple types of supporting genomic evidence. Among the double minutes identified in the pediatric tumor, only one carrying EGFR was maintained at high abundance in both samples, whereas two others were resent in only trace amounts at diagnosis but abundant at relapse, and the rest were found either in the relapse sample only or in the diagnosis sample only. For the EGFR-carrying double minutes, we found a secondary somatic deletion in all copies at relapse, after erlotinib treatment, but this was rare at diagnosis, suggesting potential resistance to the EGFR inhibitor. This mutation caused an in-frame RNA transcript to skip exon 16, a novel transcript absent in EST database and in about 700 brain tumors that we reviewed. We observed similar patterns involving longitudinal copy number shift of double minutes in another four pairs (diagnosis / relapse) of adult glioblastoma. Overall, in three of five paired tumor samples, we found that although the same oncogenes were amplified at diagnosis and relapse, they were amplified on different double minutes. Our results suggest that double minutes readily evolve, increasing tumor heterogeneity rapidly. Understanding patterns of double minute evolution can shed light on future therapeutic solutions to brain tumors carrying such variants."

EGAS00001003230,integrative epigenomic characterisation  glioblastoma hipo project 016,"Cancer Master Regulators (MRs) are proteins that define the cell state of cancer cells via transcriptional regulation. As the epigenome of a cell is highly correlated with the transcriptome, it therefore follows that transcription factor (TF) proteins acting as cancer MRs are also likely to regulate the epigenome, which itself will  affect the activity of TF MRs. Human adult glioblastoma (GB) consists of four methylation subtypes. However, the epigenetic landscape of each subtype remains largely uncharacterised, as well as the interplay between MR activity and the epigenome. Here we present an integrated epigenomic characterisation and MR identification of GB subtypes using a cohort of 60 deeply characterised adult GBs, identifying SOX10 as a master regulator of the RTK_I subtype, and whose loss causes a transition to the MES subtype. We describe differences between subtypes in their methylation and chromatin landscapes at base-pair resolution, including a novel CpG Island  Methylator Phenotype (CIMP)-like  pattern of hypermethylation targeting normal brain bivalent promoters in the RTK_II subtype. We identified 10 consensus MRs using orthogonal analyses of superenhancers and gene  co- expression networks, and we show  that the removal of SOX10 in an RTK_I model results in MR activation, phenotypic, and epigenetic changes characteristic of the MES subtype. Our analysis is the first comprehensive comparative analysis of GB subtype epigenomes, and illustrates the interplay between epigenetics, gene  expression and MR activity.(HIPO project 016)"

MSI CRCs, however, also contain more point mutations than microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors, yet they have not been as comprehensively studied. To identify candidate driver genes affected by point mutations in MSI CRC, we ranked genes based on mutation significance while correcting for replication timing and gene expression utilizing an algorithm, MutSigCV. Somatic point mutation data from the exome kit-targeted area from 24 exome sequenced sporadic MSI CRCs and respective normals, and 12 whole genome sequenced sporadic MSI CRCs and respective normals were utilized. The top 73 genes were validated in 93 additional MSI CRCs."

EGAS00001003227, exome sequencing  multiple myeloma,"By whole exome sequencing (WES) our group observed the accumulation of mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), adhesion molecules and their effectors and developed a signaling network that was affected by at least one mutation in almost 100% of MM patients and by more than one mutation in around 50% of MM patients which we decided to call inter- and intra-individual pathway redundancy. Interestingly, the extension of our WES dataset to 67 primary MM samples with correspond normal tissue which were collected at the Medizinische Klinik and Poliklinik II in Würzburg within the frame of the CRU216 has tentatively led to the designation of three molecular subgroups based on their mutation profile: ""adhesion only"", ""adhesion &amp; downstream"" and ""RTK &amp; adhesion &amp; downstream"
EGAS00001003229,  vivo colon tissues  patient derived organoids  performed wgs  wes  estimate  copy number variants  point mutations,"Patient-derived organoid is a recently developed powerful system to study the molecular mechanisms of cancers, especially for the colorectal cancer, one of most prevalent cancer worldwide. However, the similarities and differences of gene expression patterns of the organoids in culture and corresponding cancer cells in vivo were still largely unexplored. Here, we established patient-derived organoid lines from CRC patients that closely recapitulate in vivo molecular diversity of human colorectal cancer. We performed single-cell RNA-Seq for pairwise samples from seven patients for both organoids in culture and their corresponding tissues in vivo. We found that normal-derived organoid exhibited tumor-like feature at transcriptome but remained normal at genome. Tumor-derived organoid not only recapitulate the in vivo tumor transcriptome and genome features, but also keep the p-TME state and maintain the crosstalk between cancer epithelial cell and mesenchymal cell at early passage. We also found that PPAR antagonist can inhibit the proliferation of colon cancer."

Here, we characterize the metabolic landscape of glioblastoma (GBM) and explore metabolic specificities as targetable vulnerabilities. Our studies highlight the metabolic heterogeneity in GBM, in which FCCs harness aerobic glycolysis, and slow-cycling cells (SCCs) preferentially utilize mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for their functions. SCCs display enhanced invasion and chemoresistance, suggesting their important role in tumor recurrence. SCCs also demonstrate increased lipid contents that are specifically metabolized under glucose-deprived conditions. Increased fatty acid transport in SCCs is targetable by pharmacological inhibition or genomic deletion of FABP7, both of which sensitize SCCs to metabolic stress. Furthermore, FABP7 inhibition, whether alone or in combination with glycolysis inhibition, leads to overall increased survival. Our studies reveal the existence of GBM cell subpopulations with distinct metabolic requirements and suggest that FABP7 is central to lipid metabolism in SCCs and that targeting FABP7-related metabolic pathways is a viable therapeutic strategy."

Detection of cell-free tumor DNA (cftDNA) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been proposed as an alternative to detection in plasma. We used shallow whole-genome sequencing (sWGS, at a coverage of &lt; 0.4x) of cell-free DNA from the CSF of 13 patients with primary glioma to determine somatic copy number alterations and DNA fragmentation patterns. This allowed us to determine the presence of cftDNA in CSF without any prior knowledge of point mutations present in the tumor. We also showed that the fragmentation pattern of cell-free DNA in CSF is different from that in plasma. This low-cost screening method provides information on the tumor genome and can be used to target those patients with high levels of cftDNA for further larger-scale sequencing, such as by whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing."

Using optimized single cell multiomics sequencing together with multiregional sampling of the primary tumor, lymphatic and distant metastases, we provide insights beyond intratumoral heterogeneity. Genome wide DNA methylation levels were relatively consistent within a single genetic sublineage. The genome-wide DNA demethylation patterns of cancer cells were consistent in all 10 sequenced patients. The cancer cells’ DNA demethylation degrees clearly correlated with the densities of the heterochromatin-associated histone modification H3K9me3 of normal tissue, and those of repetitive element Long Interspersed Nuclear Element 1.

EGAS00001002908,dynamics  multiple resistance mechanisms  plasma dna   clinical implications  nsclc patients receiving egfr targeted therapies,"Background:The development of resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies is complicated by underlying tumour heterogeneity. When multiple resistance mechanisms co-exist, identifying the dominant driver(s) is critical for selection of treatment. Patients and methods:We studied the relative dynamics of multiple oncogenic drivers and resistance mechanisms in 50 patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), during treatment with gefitinib and hydroxychloroquine (NCT00809237). We performed digital PCR and targeted deep sequencing of cell-free DNA from longitudinal plasma samples from all patients, and shallow whole genome sequencing of serial samples from three patients who underwent histological transformation to small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). ResultsEGFR activating mutations were assessed in tumour samples and accurately identified in plasma samples of 95% of patients (41/43). We identified additional mutations including EGFR T790M (31/50, 62%), TP53 (23/50, 46%), PIK3CA (7/50, 14%), and PTEN (4/50, 8%), and tracked their relative levels in plasma. Patients with both TP53 and EGFR mutations detected in plasma pre-treatment tended to have worse overall survival than those where only EGFR was detected. The resistance-conferring EGFR T790M mutation was identified in 62% of the patients who progressed. Changes in relative levels of T790M and activating mutations in EGFR corresponded to clinical responses in two patients who were given sequential treatments. Patients who progressed without T790M detected in plasma had worse PFS during TKI continuation, and developed alternative resistance mechanisms, that could be identified in plasma DNA, including SCLC-associated copy number changes and TP53 mutations, that tracked with progression and response to subsequent therapies. Conclusion:Longitudinal analysis of multiple oncogenic drivers in ctDNA may help identifying dominant mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies, and highlight the importance of monitoring genetic events that are not direct drug targets but provide non-invasive molecular information that may guide clinical management."

Therefore, good in vitro models that encompass unique subtypes are urgently needed for precision medicine development. Here, we have established a primary gastric cancer organoid (GCO) biobank that comprises normal, dysplastic, cancer and lymph node metastases (n=63) from 34 patients, including detailed whole-exome and transcriptome analysis. The cohort encompasses most known molecular subtypes (including EBV, MSI, intestinal/CIN, and diffuse/GS, with CLDN18-ARHGAP6 or CTNND1-ARHGAP26 fusions or RHOA mutations), capturing regional heterogeneity and subclonal architecture, while their morphology, transcriptome, and genomic profiles remain closely similar to in vivo tumors, even after long-term culture. Large-scale drug screening revealed sensitivity to unexpected drugs that were recently approved or in clinical trials, including Napabucasin, Abemaciclib,  and the ATR inhibitor VE-822. Overall, this new GCO biobank, with linked genomic data, provides a useful resource for studying both cancer cell biology and precision cancer therapy."

EGAS00001003262,combination  flow cytometry  functional imaging  monitoring  residual disease  myeloma,"The iliac crest is the sampling site for minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring in Multiple Myeloma (MM). However, the disease distribution is often heterogeneous, and imaging can be used to complement MRD detection at a single site. We have investigated patients in complete remission (CR) during first-line or salvage therapy, for whom MRD flow-cytometry and the two imaging modalities positron-emission-tomography (PET) and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) were performed at the onset of CR. Residual focal lesions (FLs), detectable in 24% of first-line patients, were associated with short progression-free survival (PFS), with DW-MRI detecting disease in more patients. In some patients, FLs were only PET-positive, indicating that the two approaches are complementary. Combining MRD and imaging improved prediction of outcome, with double-negative and double-positive features defining groups with excellent and dismal PFS, respectively. FLs were a rare event (12%) in first-line MRD-negative CR patients. In contrast, patients achieving an MRD-negative CR during salvage therapy frequently had FLs (50%). Multi-region sequencing and imaging in an MRD-negative patient showed persistence of spatially separated clones. In conclusion, we show that DW-MRI is a promising tool for monitoring residual disease that complements PET and should be combined with MRD."

We applied a systematic genomic approach based on karyotyping (N=4), genotyping by genome-wide SNP array (N=33), whole-exome sequencing (N=4), and whole-genome sequencing (N=12). We performed genome-wide linkage analysis, family-based association analysis, and polygenic risk score estimates. Significant linkage was obtained at chromosome 9 (9q33.1-33.2, LOD score= 4.11), a suggestive region that contains five candidate genes ASTN2, BRINP1, C5, TLR4, and TRIM32, previously associated to MMDs. Comprehensive analysis associated the MMD phenotype with genes of the immune system with dual brain functions. Moreover, the psychotic phenotype was enriched for genes involved in synapsis. These results should be considered once studying the genetics of psychiatric disorders in other families, especially the ones from the same region, since founder effects may be related to the high prevalence."
EGAS00001003892,multimodal genomic features predict outcome  immune checkpoint blockade   small cell lung cancer,"Despite progress in immunotherapy, identifying patients that respond has remained a challenge. Through analysis of whole-exome and targeted sequence data from 5,449 tumors, we found a significant correlation between tumor mutation burden (TMB) and tumor purity, suggesting that low tumor purity tumors are likely to have inaccurate TMB estimates. We developed a new method to estimate a corrected TMB (cTMB) that was adjusted for tumor purity and more accurately predicted outcome to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). To identify improved predictive markers together with cTMB, we performed whole-exome sequencing for 104 lung tumors treated with ICB. Through comprehensive analyses of sequence and structural alterations, we discovered a significant enrichment in activating mutations in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) genes in non-responding tumors in three immunotherapy-treated cohorts. An integrated multivariable model incorporating cTMB, RTK mutations, smoking-related mutational signature, and HLA status provided an improved predictor of response to immunotherapy that was independently validated."

Adult and neonatal pancreata shared common features, including the presence of previously undetected acinar subtypes, but also showed marked differences in the composition of the endocrine, endothelial, and immune compartments. Spatial cartography, including cell proximity mapping through in situ sequencing, revealed dynamic developmental cell topographies in the endocrine and exocrine pancreas.

We generated an EVI1-GFP AML model and applied an unbiased CRISPR/Cas9 enhancer scan to uncover sequence motifs essential for EVI1 transcription. Using this approach, we pinpoint a single regulatory element in the translocated GATA2 enhancer that is critically required for aberrant EVI1 expression while being dispensable for GATA2 expression from its endogenous locus. This element contains a DNA binding motif for the transcription factor MYB that heavily occupies this site specifically at the translocated allele. MYB knockout as well as peptidomimetic blockade of p300-dependent MYB function resulted in downregulation of EVI1 but not of GATA2. Targeting MYB or mutating its DNA-binding motif within the GATA2 enhancer resulted in myeloid differentiation and cell death, suggesting that interference with MYB-driven EVI1 transcription provides a potential entry point for therapy of inv(3)/t(3;3) AMLs."

Differences in cellular states, biopsy cell composition, and tumor microenvironment may all lead to ITH. Here we analyze ITH at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels to ascertain whether subtype discordance between multiregional biopsies reflects relevant biological ITH or lack of classifier robustness. Further, we study the impact of tumor location on ITH.MethodsMultiregional biopsies from stage II and III CRC tumors were analyzed by RNA sequencing (41 biopsies, 14 tumors) and multiplex immune protein analysis (89 biopsies, 29 tumors). CRC subtyping were performed using consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), CRC intrinsic subtypes (CRIS), and TUMOR types. ITH-scores and network maps were defined to determine the origin of heterogeneity. A validation cohort was used with one biopsy per tumor (162 tumors).ResultsOverall, inter-tumor transcriptional variation exceeded ITH, and subtyping calls were frequently concordant between multiregional biopsies. Still, some tumors had high ITH and were classified discordantly. Proximal tumors showed ITH related to differences in the microenvironment, while ITH within distal tumors were cancer-cell related. This subtype discordancy reflected actual molecular ITH within the tumors. The relevance of the subtypes was reflected at protein level where several inflammation markers were significantly increased in immune related transcriptional subtypes, which was verified in an independent cohort (Wilcoxon rank sum test; p&lt;0.05).ConclusionOur transcriptomic and proteomic analyses show that the tumor location along the colorectum influence the ITH of CRC, which again influence the concordance of subtyping."

Treatment options for metastatic PAC are limited and often follow chemotherapeutic regimens for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Although recurrent genomic alterations, such as BRAF fusions and defects in genes involved in homologous recombination DNA repair, have been described in PAC, data on the clinical efficacy of molecularly guided, targeted treatment are scarce. Here we describe the case of a 27-yr-old patient with BRAF V600E-mutated PAC who was successfully treated with a combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors. The patient presented to our clinic with abdominal pain and weight loss. Imaging showed extensive retroperitoneal disease as well as mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Because of elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels and inconclusive histologic findings, a germ cell tumor was suspected; however, PEI chemotherapy was unsuccessful. A repeat biopsy yielded the diagnosis of PAC and treatment with FOLFIRINOX was initiated. Comprehensive molecular profiling within the MASTER (Molecularly Aided Stratification for Tumor Eradication Research) precision oncology program revealed a somatic BRAF V600E mutation and a germline PALB2 stop-gain mutation. Therapy was therefore switched to BRAF/MEK inhibition, resulting in almost complete remission and disease control for 12 mo and a remarkable improvement in the patient's general condition. These results indicate that BRAF alterations are a valid therapeutic target in PAC that should be routinely assessed in this patient population."

Its genetic architecture is thought to be the result of the joint effect of common and rare variants. Families with high prevalence are an interesting approach to shed light on the rare variant's contribution without the need of collecting large cohorts. To unravel the genomic architecture of a family enriched for psychosis, with four affected individuals, we applied a system genomic approach based on karyotyping, genotyping by whole-exome sequencing to search for rare single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and SNP array to search for copy-number variants (CNVs). We identified a rare non-synonymous variant, g.39914279 C&amp;gt;G, in the MACF1 gene, segregating with psychosis. Rare variants in the MACF1 gene have been previously detected in SCZ patients. Besides, two rare CNVs, DUP3p26.3 and DUP16p23.3, were also identified in the family affecting relevant genes (CNTN6 and CDH13, respectively).

LT-HSC and ST-HSC from 3 pool of CB lin- were FACS-purified, cells were prestimulated for 4 hours and transduced with lentiviral vectors. At day 3, 2000-5300 BFP+ cells were FACS-purified for RNA isolation with a PicoPure kit.  We were able to isolate only 1600-1800 BFP+ cells from LT-HSC control samples as opposed to 4000-5400 BFP+ cells from S1PR3OE samples. Thus, we pooled all control BFP+ LT-HSC cells into one sample for RNA-seq analysis. BFP- LT-HSC from control vector transduction were purified from CB1 as an additional LT-HSC control. Nextera libraries generated from 10 ng RNA from 5 LT-HSC samples (2 controls, 3 S1PR3OE) and 6 ST-HSC samples (3 controls, 3 S1PR3OE) were subjected to 125 bp, paired-end RNA-sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 with an average of 50 million reads/sample at the Center for Applied Genomics, Sick Kids Hospital."

EGAS00001003172,castration persistence   distinct state  tolerance  androgen receptor targeting therapies  prostate cancer,"Androgen receptor (AR) signalling is important in prostate cancer progression, and therapies that specifically target this pathway are the mainstay of treatment for advanced disease. Treatment however is non-curative, and resistance develops inevitably with time. Although the mechanisms that drive progressive ‘castration resistant’ disease are reasonably well characterized, how tumours survive acute pathway inhibition is unclear. We performed a neo-adjuvant study of a novel combination of AR targeting therapies, and noted that the objective response to treatment was highly variable. To determine what was driving tumour persistence in poorly responding patients, we comprehensively characterised pre- and post-treatment samples were using both whole genome and RNA-sequencing. We find that ‘castration-persistence’ is a distinct state from ‘castration-resistance’, and is mediated by global transcriptional reprogramming leading to transitional EMT state, which is shared with benign luminal epithelial cells. This appears to be AP-1 and KLF driven, and represents and integration of multiple signalling pathways, particularly IGF2, offering a number of tractable strategies to improve clinical response to AR targeting therapies."
EGAS00001004832,opacin neo  multicenter phase 2 study  identify  optimal neo adjuvant combination scheme  ipilimumab  nivolumab  exome sequencing,"The outcome of patients with macroscopic stage III melanoma is poor. Neoadjuvant treatment with ipilimumab plus nivolumab at the standard dosing schedule induced pathological responses in a high proportion of patients in two small independent early-phase trials. However, toxicity of the standard ipilimumab plus nivolumab dosing schedule was high, preventing its broader clinical use. The aim of the OpACIN-neo study (NCT02977052) to identify a dosing schedule of ipilimumab plus nivolumab that is less toxic but equally effective. 86 patients with macroscopic stage III melanoma were randomised to one of three dosing schedules: arm A, two cycles of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg plus nivolumab 1 mg/kg once every 3 weeks; arm B, two cycles of ipilimumab 1 mg/kg plus nivolumab 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks; or arm C, two cycles of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks directly followed by two cycles of nivolumab 3mg/kg once every 2 weeks. Within the first 12 weeks, grade 3–4 immune-related adverse events were observed in 12 (40%) of 30 patients in group A, six (20%) of 30 in group B, and 13 (50%) of 26 in group C. Pathological responses occurred in 24 (80%) patients in group A, 23 (77%) in group B, and 17 (65%) in group C. The 2-year estimated relapse-free survival was 84% for all patients, 97% for patients achieving a pathologic response and 36% for nonresponders (p&lt;0.001). High tumor mutational burden (TMB) and high interferon-gamma-related gene expression signature score (IFN-γ score) were associated with pathologic response and low risk of relapse; pathologic response rate (pRR) was 100% in patients with high IFN-γ score/high TMB, patients with high IFN-γ score/low TMB or low IFN-γ score/high TMB had pRRs of 91% and 88%; while patients with low IFN-γ score/low TMB had a pRR of only 39%. These data demonstrate long-term benefit in patients with a pathologic response and show the predictive potential of TMB and IFN-γ score."

To identify biomarkers and decipher the mechanisms for response and irAEs, we performed multi-dimensional immunoprofiling on peripheral blood and tissue collected before and during anti-PD1 ICB treatment from HCC patients. Single-cell analyses enabled us to identify peripheral biomarkers, in particular, CD11c+ antigen-presenting cells with varying degrees of HLA-DR expression and CD8 effector memory (EM) T cells with CXCR3 tissue-homing capability that are associated with both response and irAEs. We also dissected the mechanisms behind how these immune subsets interface between response and toxicity, showing their intersecting yet diverging trajectories leading to these distinct clinical fates. This study offers new insights on the mechanisms and potentially novel strategies to enhance response and ameliorate irAEs in cancer immunotherapy."

Here, we analysed three synchronous primaries and a recurrence from one patient, by comparing the genomic and transcriptomic profiles among the tumour samples and determining the recurrence origin. We found remarkable levels of heterogeneity among the primary tumours, and through the patterns of shared mutations, we traced the origin of the recurrence. Interestingly, the patient carried germline variants which might have predisposed him to carcinogenesis, together with a history of alcohol and tobacco consumption. Mutational signature analysis confirmed the impact of alcohol exposure, with Signature 16 present in all tumour samples. Characterisation of immune cell infiltration highlighted an immunosuppressive environment in all samples, which exceeded the potential activity of T cells.

EGAS00001005798,persistence  circulating tumor dna  breast cancer patients  neoadjuvant treatment    predictor  poor tumor response,"Purpose:Accurate assessment of response during neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NST) poses a major clinical challenge. Therefore, a minimally-invasive assessment of tumor response based on cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) may be beneficial to guide treatment decisions.Experimental Design: We profiled 93 genes in tissue from 193 early breast cancer patients. Patient-specific assays were designed to track ctDNA during NST from 145 patients with available plasma. ctDNA presence and levels were correlated with complete pathological response (pCR) and residual cancer burden (RCB) as well as with clinicopathologic characteristics of the tumor to identify potential proxies for ctDNA release. Moreover, we tested the predictive value of driver events identified in the tumor.Results:At baseline, ctDNA could be detected in 63/145 (43.4%) patients and persisted in 25/63 (39.7%) patients at mid-therapy (MT) and 15/63 (23.8%) patients at the end of treatment. ctDNA detection at MT was significantly associated with higher RCB (OR 0.062, 95% CI 0.01-0.48, P=0.0077). Out of 31 patients with detectable ctDNA at MT, 30 patients (96.8%) were non-responders (RCB II, n=8; RCB III, n=22) and only one patient responded to the treatment (RCB I). Considering all 145 patients with baseline (BL) plasma, none of the patients with RCB 0 and only 6.7% of patients with RCB I had ctDNA detectable at MT, while 30.6% and 29.6% of patients with RCB II/III, respectively, had a positive ctDNA result. Conclusion:Overall, our results demonstrate that the detection and persistence of ctDNA at mid-therapy may have the potential to negatively predict response to neoadjuvant treatment and identify patients who will not achieve pCR or be classified with RCB II/III."
EGAS00001004121,germline elongator mutations  sonic hedgehog medulloblastoma deprecated duplicate,"Cancer genomics has illuminated a wide spectrum of genes and core molecular processes contributing to human malignancy. Still, the genetic and molecular basis of many cancers remains only partially explained. Genetic predisposition accounts for 5-10% of cancer diagnoses and genetic events cooperating with known somatic driver events are poorly understood.

Analyzing established cancer predisposition genes in medulloblastoma (MB), a malignant childhood brain tumor, we recently identified pathogenic germline variants that account for 5% of all MB patients.
Here, by extending our previous analysis to include all protein-coding genes, we discovered and replicated rare germline loss-of-function (LoF) variants across Elongator Complex Protein 1 (ELP1) on 9q31.3 in 15% of pediatric MBSHH cases, thus implicating ELP1 as the most common MB predisposition gene and increasing genetic predisposition to 40% for pediatric MBSHH.
Inheritance was verified based on parent-offspring and pedigree analysis, which identified two families with a history of pediatric MB. ELP1-associated MBs were restricted to the molecular SHHa subtype and were characterized by universal biallelic inactivation of ELP1 due to somatic loss of chromosome 9q.
The majority of ELP1-associated MBs exhibited co-occurring somatic PTCH1 (9q22.32) alterations, suggesting that ELP1-deficiency predisposes to tumor development in combination with constitutive activation of SHH signaling. 

ELP1 is an essential subunit of the evolutionary conserved Elongator complex, whose primary function is to enable efficient translational elongation through tRNAs modifications at the wobble (U34) position.
Biochemical, transcriptional, and proteomic analyses revealed that ELP1-associated MBSHH are characterized by a destabilized core elongator complex, loss of elongator-dependent tRNA modifications, codon-dependent translational reprogramming, and induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR), consistent with deregulation of protein homeostasis due to elongator-deficiency in model systems.

Our findings suggest that genetic predisposition to proteome instability is a previously underappreciated determinant in the pathogenesis of pediatric brain cancer. These results provide strong rationale for further investigating the role of protein homeostasis in other pediatric and adult cancer types and potential opportunities for novel therapeutic interference."

However, despite the availability of many computational tools, fusion detection remains challenging. Existing methods suffer from poor prediction accuracy and are computationally demanding. We developed Arriba, a novel fusion detection algorithm with high sensitivity and short runtime. When applied to a large collection of published pancreatic cancer samples (n=803), Arriba identified a variety of driver fusions, many of which affected druggable proteins, including ALK, BRAF, FGFR2, NRG1, NTRK1, NTRK3, RET, and ROS1. The fusions were significantly associated with KRAS wild-type tumors and involved proteins stimulating the MAPK signaling pathway, suggesting that they substitute for activating mutations in KRAS. In addition, we confirmed the transforming potential of two novel fusions, RRBP1-RAF1 and RASGRP1-ATP1A1, in cellular assays. These results demonstrate Arriba’s utility in both basic cancer research and clinical translation."
EGAS00001002882,scrna seq data  human nuclei collected   temporal cortex  17 individuals,"Transcriptome analysis of single cells has tremendously increased our understanding of cellular heterogeneity in complex tissues. However, whole-cell transcriptomics cannot be applied to frozen tissue due to poor cell recovery after freezing. Human tissue is usually limited to tissue banks containing frozen material, and since single nuclei can be readily isolated from frozen tissues, human cell nuclei can substitute whole-cell analysis to extract single cell transcriptomes from human cells. Despite the importance of human tissue analysis, single-nucleus RNA-sequencing protocols are less developed than those for whole cells. SMARTSeq, either in form of custom-made SMARTSeq2 or as part of the Fluidigm C1 platform, provides a high resolution view of the transcriptome, has proven effective for whole-cell analysis and has recently been adapted to nuclei. Here, we show that the standard SMARTSeq2 protocol applied to single nuclei biases the amplification of single-nucleus transcriptomes due to unspecific capturing of transcripts, which can comprise the majority of reads in single-nucleus RNA-sequencing libraries. We demonstrate that modification of the SMARTSeq2 protocol with respect to template switching and cDNA amplification conditions generates sequencing libraries of higher complexity, allows for detection of more genes and reduces biases of the amplified transcriptome. In addition, modification of SMARTSeq2 chemistry allows for gene detection at shallower sequencing depth, thus increasing efficiency and decreasing cost."
EGAS00001003870,comprehensive genomic characterization  gene therapy induced t cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia h007,"Six out of ten patients in a hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy (GT) trial for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) developed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) associated with gamma-retroviral vector integration at the LMO2 locus. We hypothesized that detailed molecular analysis of T-ALL driven by temporally defined first deregulation of LMO2 might offer valuable insights into the pathogenesis of GT-associated and sporadic T-ALL (HIPO project 007). In all six patients whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing demonstrated that in addition to oncogenic chromosomal translocations involving the T-cell receptor loci, retrovirally induced leukemias faithfully recapitulated secondary genomic events observed in sporadic T-ALL. Multiple genetic events culminated in the development of a rapidly proliferating leukemic clone and onset of clinical manifestation at 1.3 to 5 years after infusion of the gene corrected transplant. These genetic alterations affected NOTCH1 and PI3K signaling, cell cycle regulation as wells as T-cell transcription factors LEF1 and TCF1. Two of the six cases displayed a phenotype reminiscent of early immature T-ALLs, and lacked additional T-ALL typical alterations. Our analysis shows that insertional mutagenesis involving the LMO2 locus triggers T-ALL development due to diverse genetic alterations in large parts, but not exclusively, in known T-ALL driver genes, demonstrating the molecular diversity of GT-associated T-ALL."

Nearly two years after diagnosis, she developed neurological deficits from an intradural, extramedullary tumor anterior to the spinal cord at T4, which was resected and diagnosed as gliosarcoma. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) of this tumor revealed a hypermutated phenotype, characterized by somatic mutations in key DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway genes, an abundance of C&gt;T transitions within the identified somatic SNVs, and microsatellite stability, together consistent with temozolomide-mediated hypermutagenesis.

EGAS00001005797,imputation performance  latin american populations improving rare variant estimations   inclusion  native american genomes,"Current Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) rely on genotype imputation to increase statistical power, improve fine-mapping of association signals, and facilitate meta-analyses. Due to the complex demographic history of Latin America and the lack of balanced representation of Native American genomes in current imputation panels, the discovery of locally relevant disease variants is likely to be missed, limiting the scope and impact of biomedical research in these populations. Therefore, the necessity of better diversity representation in genomic databases is a scientific imperative. Here, we expand the 1000 Genomes reference panel (1KGP) with 134 Native American genomes (84 publicly available + 50 newly sequenced genomes) to assess imputation performance in Latin American individuals of mixed ancestry. Our panel increased the number of SNPs above the GWAS quality threshold, thus improving statistical power for association studies in the region.

Different patterns of somatic mutation are generated by the different environmental, lifestyle and genetic factors that cause cancer, many of them are still unknown. Within Mutographs, Kings College London will characterise the mutational signatures induced by putative human carcinogens in order to identify the origins of mutational signatures found in human cancers. To achieve this human organoid cell cultures will be exposed to a representative catalogue of known or suspected human carcinogens and mutagens and, using whole genome sequencing, the patterns of mutations induced by them will be determined. Somatic mutational signatures will be subsequently extracted by non-negative matrix factorisation methods and correlated with exposure data. 
Through an enhanced understanding of cancer aetiology, Mutographs unprecedented effort is anticipated to outline modifiable risk factors, lead to new approaches to prevent cancer, and provide opportunities to empower early detection, refine high-risk groups and contribute to further therapeutic development."

We targeted the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene of S. mansoni using two synthetic guide RNAs (gRNAs), X5 and X7, respectively. Liver eggs of S. mansoni were exposed to CRISPR-vector containing X5 or X7 by electroporation. Simultaneously, eggs were transfected with a ssODN donor encoding a stop codon in all six frames. Next generation sequencing analysis revealed that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing in S. mansoni eggs resulted in Homology-Directed Repair (HDR) when template DNA ssODN provided. Furthermore, soluble egg antigen (SEA) from AChE-modified eggs exhibited markedly reduced AChE activity compared with controls, indicative that programmed Cas9 cleavage mutated the AChE gene. Following injection of modified schistosome eggs into the tail veins of mice, a significant decrease in granuloma size in the lungs of these animals. Notably, an enhanced Th2 response induced by eggs in lung, and splenocytes small intestine-draining mesenteric lymph node cells was also generated in mice injected with X5-KI eggs in different methods. These findings further demonstrate the power and utility of CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing for undertaking functional genomics studies in schistosomes."
EGAS00001004861,bulk rna sequencing  high grade pancreatic   pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms,"Therapeutic decisions in oncology depend on a precise pathological classification of individual neoplasms. Recent years have seen an intensification of research activities aimed at the extraction of clinically relevant information from patient-derived 'omics' data based on Machine-Learning models. However, a comprehensive training of Machine-Learning models requires sufficiently large numbers of training samples, which are usually not available for rare cancer types. The problem is worsened when individual tissues segregate into different cancer subtypes, as their discrimination would require even more training samples.
Methods:
Here, we report on a new data-augmentation technique to support the training of Machine-Learning models on ‘omics’ data from pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (panNEN). PanNENs display all properties described above: Only about 2-3% of all pancreatic neoplasms are neuroendocrine and they fall into different subtypes with distinctly different prognosis, which makes the precise classification of such samples both difficult and important for therapy decisions. The approach reconstructs a given transcriptome based on healthy pancreatic cell type signatures and creates a Machine-Learning model that integrates the observed reconstruction error and predicted cell type proportions as features. 
Results:
A benchmark of the deconvolution model predictions with the ground-truth found that the model could efficiently predict the sample grading, disease-related patient survival time, and differentiate between different subtypes in four panNEN and one mixed panNEN and non-pancreatic NENs dataset. We compared the predictive performance of the deconvolution-trained model to that of a model trained directly on the transcriptomic data, under inclusion of the Ki-67 classification gold standard biomarker, and found the performances to be comparable.
Conclusion:
Our approach serves as a data-augmentation technique to facilitate  the training of Machine Learning  models for rare cancer types via utilization of data from healthy origin. Additionally, the deconvolution results were clinically interpretable and further research can render the deconvolution approach an effective complementary asset for the clinical classification of neoplasms."

Among these tumors, mutually exclusive missense mutations at either lysine 27 (K27M) or glycine 34 (G34R/V) in the tail of histone 3.3 define two clinical-molecular groups, which segregate by location and age of incidence, suggesting distinct neurodevelopmental contexts of originH3 G34R/V gliomas are genomically distinct from their H3 K27M-mutant and histone-wildtype counterparts. Notably, the H3.3 G34R/V mutation is found in a histologically heterogeneous group of brain tumors that comprise glioblastomas, but also neoplasms formerly defined as primitive neuroectodermal tumors (CNS-PNETs).To more extensively characterize the pathophysiological basis and to derive targetable strategies against  H3.3 G34R/V mutant paediatric gliomas, we here combine ChIP sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing, single-cell sequencing approaches and genome-wide CRISPR-screening in  patient-derived H3 G34R/V tumor cells. Our integrative analysis reveals both vulnerabilities associated with a putative GABAergic interneuronal progenitor lineage and clinically actionable targets, as validated using functional approaches."

These tumors show exquisite regional and temporal specificity, suggesting a developmental context permissive to the effects of G34R/V mutations. Here we present the molecular landscape of G34R/V gliomas (n=85) and show that 50% bear activating mutations in PDGFRA, with strong selection pressure for PDGFRAMUT clones at recurrence. We show that G34R/V tumors arise in interneuron progenitors of the foetal ventral forebrain expressing GSX2 and the DLX family of homeobox transcription factors, where terminal neuronal differentiation is impaired through aberrant G34R/V-mediated H3K27me3. Frequent co-occurrence of G34R/V &amp; PDGFRAMUT is facilitated in this interneuron lineage-of-origin as PDGFRA forms an aberrant chromatin loop with the adjacent GSX2, hijacking its active chromatin conformation. At the single-cell level, G34R/V tumours entirely lack oligodendroglial transcriptional programs prominent in other glioma entities, and instead harbour dual neuronal and astroglial compartments. CRISPR-removal of H3.3G34R/V does not impact tumorigenicity suggesting this mutation becomes dispensable, while PDGFRAMUT are potently oncogenic regardless of G34 mutation. Collectively, our results suggest that G34R/V gliomas arise in foetal interneuron progenitors unable to undergo terminal differentiation, enabling co-option of PDGFRA through inappropriate expression and activating mutations to promote gliogenesis and oncogenicity. Reliance on PDGFRA for oncogenesis may be of therapeutic opportunity in G34R/V glioma."

Clinical outcome following CRT varies greatly. We hypothesized tumor microRNA (miRNA) expression is predictive for outcome following CRT. Methods: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) miRNA profiling was performed on 37 formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor samples. Patients with a recurrence free survival (RFS) of less than 2 years (“poor  outcome”) and patients without recurrence within 2 years (“good outcome”) were compared by differential expression analysis. Tumor-specific miRNAs were selected based on normal mucosa miRNA expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. A model was constructed to predict outcome using group-regularized penalized logistic ridge regression. Candidate miRNAs were validated in the initial sample set by RT-qPCR as well as in 46 additional tumor samples.Results: 1,938 known mature miRNAs were detected. Thirteen miRNAs were differentially expressed (p&lt;0.05, FDR&lt;0.1) according to outcome group. Initial class prediction in the NGS cohort (n=37) resulted in a model combining five miRNAs and disease stage, able to predict CRT outcome with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.82. In the RT-qPCR cohort (n=83), 25 patients (30%) experienced early recurrence (median RFS 8 months; median follow-up 42 months). Class prediction resulted in a model combining let-7i-5p and miR-192-5p and disease stage, able to discriminate with an AUC of 0.80 patients with good versus poor clinical outcome.Conclusion: The combined miRNA expression and disease stage prediction model is superior to using either factor alone. ¬¬¬This study indicates NGS miRNA profiling using FFPE specimens is feasible, resulting in clinically relevant biomarkers."
EGAS00001004877,accurate detection  tumor specific fusion genes reveals  immunogenic personal neo antigens,"Fusion genes arising from cancer-associated somatic mutations are a potential rich source for highly immunogenic neo-antigens. However, their exploitation as targets for personalized cancer immunotherapy is currently limited by the lack of computational tools allowing transcriptome-wide identification of unique fusion genes in an accurate and sensitive manner. Here, we present EasyFuse, a computational pipeline, to detect individual and cancer-specific fusion genes in next-generation-sequencing transcriptome data obtained from human cancer samples. Using machine learning, EasyFuse predicts personal fusion genes with high precision and sensitivity and outperforms previously described approaches as qualified by an unprecedented ground-truth dataset of &gt;1500 verification experiments in relevant patient samples. By testing immunogenicity with autologous blood lymphocytes from cancer patients we detected pre-established CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses for 10 of 21 (48%), and for 1 of 30 (3%) of identified fusion genes, respectively. In conclusion, we demonstrate accurate detection of cancer-specific fusion genes. The high frequency of T cell responses detected in cancer patients support the relevance of private fusion genes as neo-antigens for personalized immunotherapies, especially for tumors with low point mutation burdens."

Here, we present Phase 1 of a multi-omics, multi-model data resource for FTD research which will allows in-depth molecular research into these mechanisms. We have integrated and analysed data from the frontal lobe of FTD patients with mutations in MAPT, GRN and C9orf72 and detected common and distinct dysregulated cellular pathways. Our results highlight that excitatory neurons are the most vulnerable neuronal cell type and that vascular aberrations are a common hallmark in FTD. Via integration of multi-omics data, we detected several transcription factors and pathways which regulate the strong neuroinflammation observed in FTD-GRN. Finally, using small RNA-seq data and verification experiments in cellular models, we identified several up-regulated miRNAs that inhibit cellular trafficking pathways in FTD and lead to microglial activation. In this work we shed light on novel mechanistic and pathophysiological hallmarks of FTD. In addition, we believe that this comprehensive, multi-omics data resource will further mechanistic FTD research by the community."

Herein, we complement PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and tumor mutation burden (TMB) with RNA-seq in 366 patients to identify unifying and indication-specific molecular profiles that can predict response to checkpoint blockade across these tumor types. Multiple machine learning approaches failed to identify a baseline transcriptional signature highly predictive of response across these indications. Signatures described previously for immune checkpoint inhibitors also failed to validate. At the pathway level, significant heterogeneity was observed between indications, in particular within the PD-L1+ tumors. mUC and NSCLC were molecularly aligned, with cell cycle and DNA damage repair genes associated with response in PD-L1- tumors. At the gene level, the CDK4/6 inhibitor CDKN2A was identified as a significant transcriptional correlate of response, highlighting the association of non-immune pathways to the outcome of checkpoint blockade. This cross-indication analysis revealed molecular heterogeneity between mUC, NSCLC and RCC tumors, suggesting that indication-specific molecular approaches should be prioritized to formulate treatment strategies."

Despite the recent development of next generation sequencing approaches, there are still some cases that their drivers are unknown. We aimed to define and describe the characteristics of an additional B-ALL subtype by integrating genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic approach.
METHODS: More than 2,000 B-ALL cases of RNA-seq data from from Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) and the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) (n=764), the Children's Oncology Group (COG), Munich Leukemia Laboratory (MLL) (n=280), and other several collaborators were analyzed to identify the new subtype. Whole genome sequence was performed to detect mutations, stractural variants, and copy number alterations. The tridimentional analysis of chromatin was performed with HiChIP.
RESULTS: We identified the new high-risk B-ALL subtype “CDX2/UBTF” that exhibited unique gene expression profiles, which is enriched in female (77.3%), adolescents and young adults (52.6%), and relapse cohort (3.3%). CD10 negativity and IgM positivity are hallmarks of this subtype with NTRK3 expression that can be an effective marker at diagnostic approach and a potential targeted therapy with TRK and mulkinase inbitors, larotrectinib and entrectinib. Genetically, two different alterations define CDX2/UBTF. One is UBTF-ATXN7L3 fusions caused by deletion of 17q21.31, and the other is extopic CDX2 expression through the enhancer hijacking mechanism induced by deletion of 13q12.2. Other genomic features include gain of 1q and PAX5 rearrangement (PAX5-ZCCHC7), might induce upregulation of histone cluster genes and PAX5.
CONCLUSION: We described the novel B-ALL subtype “CDX2/UBTF” that has unique clinical and genomic characteristics."

We profiled 29 primary-recurrent paired human GBM specimens via RNA sequencing and re-analyzed RNA-sequencing data from non-malignant human brain tissues. From these data, we reconstructed the landscape of AS in GBM through recurrence and contrasted that to isoforms observed in non-malignant brain. The AS events we identified were cross-referenced with single-cell GBM atlases to determine cell-type specific splicing patterns. From this we identified novel splicing events in cell-surface proteins that are suitable targets for engineered T-cell therapies. We found recurrent-specific isoforms of mitogen-activated kinase pathway genes which are expressed exclusively by GBM stem-like cells that enhance invasiveness. These studies shed light on the effect of therapy on AS and identify novel targets for emerging immunotherapies."

EGAS00001003953,glioblastoma epigenome profiling identifies sox10   master regulator  molecular tumour subtype,"Glioblastoma in adult patients are classified into four subtypes, IDH, MES, RTK I, and RTK II, based on DNA methylation and RNA expression data. Tumour subtype transitions commonly occur during the treatment of glioblastoma patients, and transitions to the mesenchymal (MES) subtype have been associated with therapy resistance and adverse prognosis. Here, we generate DNA methylome and histone modification data of glioblastoma primary tumours and show that glioblastoma subtypes differ by their enhancer landscapes. Using Core Regulatory Circuitry analysis of H3K27ac data, and independent analysis of RNA-derived gene regulatory networks, we identified 38 subtype master regulators whose cell type-specific activities we mapped in single-cell RNA sequencing data. These analyses identified the chromatin modifier SRY-Box 10 (SOX10) as a master regulator in tumours of the RTK I subtype. In functional studies we demonstrate that SOX10 loss causes a transition of RTK I tumour cells to a mesenchymal cellular state by altering the accessibility of enhancer-rich chromatin regions and their occupancy by Bromodomain Containing 4 (BRD4), a dynamic constituent of super-enhancers. Treatment with the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 blocked this transition.

These mutations have been shown to induce a global reduction in the repressive histone modification H3K27me3, which together with widespread changes in DNA methylation patterns results in an extensive transcriptional reprogramming hampering the identification of single therapeutic targets based on a molecular rationale. We applied a large-scale gene knockdown approach using a pooled shRNA library in combination with next-generation sequencing in order to identify DIPG-specific vulnerabilities. The therapeutic potential of specific inhibitors of candidate targets was validated in a secondary drug screen. We identified fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling and the serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as top depleted hits in patient-derived DIPG cell cultures and validated their lethal potential by FGF ligand depletion and genetic knockdown of the PP2A structural subunit PPP2R1A. Further, pharmacological inhibition of FGFR and PP2A signaling through ponatinib and LB-100 treatment, respectively, exhibited strong tumor-specific anti-proliferative and apoptotic activity in cultured DIPG cells. Our findings suggest FGFR and PP2A signaling as potential new therapeutic targets for the treatment of DIPGs."

Oligodendrocyte (OL) pathology is increasingly implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, as they are involved in metabolic support of axons and functional cross-talk with other brain cells. Rodent OLs are heterogeneous, with developmental and biological differences, but the extent of heterogeneity in the normal human brain and its contribution to any changes to disease remains unknown. Here we performed single nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) from white matter (WM) areas of post mortem human brain both in control (Ctr) and multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. We identified several sub-clusters of oligodendroglia in the Ctr human WM, some similar to those in mouse, and defined new markers for these cell states. Strikingly, some of these sub-clusters were under-represented in MS tissue, while others were more prevalent than in controls. We found a lack of OL precursor cells (OPCs) and an OL subcluster in an intermediate stage of differentiation in MS lesions and in normal appearing white matter (NAWM), suggesting either depletion by the disease or by a regenerative response. The differences in mature OL sub-clusters indicate different functional states of OLs in MS tissue and, as this is similar in NAWM to lesions, that MS is a more diffuse brain disease than the focal demyelinating lesions suggest. We were also able to identify new putative markers of different MS lesion subtypes. Our findings of an altered heterogeneity of oligodendroglia in MS may have an important contribution to our understanding of disease progression and may alter therapeutic approaches to MS."

Whole exome sequencing detected alterations in genes associated with both FL/DLBCL (CREBBP, KMT2C, KMT2D, ARID1A, HIST1 members, and TNFRSF14) and PMBL (JAK-STAT pathway genes, B2M, and CD58). Copy number (CN) analysis detected gains/amplification of REL in 60% and STAT6 in 40%, gains of chromosome 16, including IL4R, in 40%, and both deletions and gains of 11q in 20%. This cohort, although limited in size, supports a subset of tFL that has blended features between FL/DLBCL and PMBL. Despite having some features that are less common in DLBCL (MAL and CD23 expression, JAK-STAT activation), these cases lack the most characteristic CN alteration seen in PMBL (9p24.1 gain/amplification). This cohort expands the biologic heterogeneity of tFL, illustrating a subset with blended FL/DLBCL and PMBL features, with potential treatment implications that include the use of novel PMBL-targeted therapies."

Regulatory non-coding variants can be inspected and discovered along with coding variants, and their functional impact further explored by examining 3D genome and/or ChIP-seq data generated from cancer cell lines. Further, GenomePaint correlates mutation and expression patterns with patient outcomes, and can display external data such as adult cancer datasets and user-provided custom tracks. We used GenomePaint to analyze multi-omics data from 3,652 pediatric cancers representing 16 histotypes, and demonstrate the visualization features through examples, including two that led to new insights into oncogenic mechanisms in pediatric cancer. The first is the discovery of a new class of pathogenic recurrent variants that cause aberrant splicing, disrupting the RING domain of CREBBP, a driver gene frequently mutated in relapsed pediatric leukemia. The second is the cis-activation of the MYC oncogene in a subset of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) via duplication of the NOTCH1-MYC enhancer (N-ME), previously discovered only in T-lineage ALL. The regulatory impact of N-ME enhancer amplification was initially confirmed by allelic imbalance in published gene expression and ChIP-seq data and verified by additional Capture-C and fluorescence in situ hybridization data generated by follow-up experiments. These examples demonstrate the power of GenomePaint in enabling not only data visualization but also integrative genomic analysis that can lead to novel biological insight for follow-up experimental validation."

We use whole exome, whole genome, and/or RNA sequencing to characterize the genomic profile of 85 pediatric tMN cases (tMDS: n=29, tAML: n=56). Our data show that Ras/MAPK pathway mutations, alterations in RUNX1 or TP53, and KMT2A rearrangements are frequent somatic drivers, and we identify cases with aberrant MECOM expression secondary to enhancer hijacking. Unlike adults with tMN5-7, we find no evidence of pre-existing minor tMN clones (including those with TP53 mutations), but rather the majority of cases were unrelated clones arising as a consequence of cytotoxic therapy.

Over 50% cases are gene-elusive on clinical gene panel testing. The contribution of variants in non-coding DNA elements that result in cryptic splicing and regulate gene expression has not been explored. We analyzed whole genome sequencing (WGS) data in a discovery cohort of 209 pediatric CMP patients and 1,953 independent replication genomes and exomes. We searched for protein-coding variants, and non-coding variants predicted to affect the function or expression of genes. Thirty-nine % cases harbored pathogenic coding variants in known CMP genes, and 5% harbored high-risk loss-of-function (LoF) variants in additional candidate CMP genes. Fifteen % harbored high-risk regulatory variants in promoters and enhancers of CMP genes (Odds ratio 2.25, p=6.70×10-7 versus controls). Genes involved in α-dystroglycan glycosylation (FKTN, DTNA) and desmosomal signaling (DSC2, DSG2) were most highly enriched for regulatory variants (Odds ratio 6.7-58.1). Functional effects were confirmed in patient myocardium and reporter assays in human cardiomyocytes, and in zebrafish CRISPR knockouts.

EGAS00001004878,pancreatic small intestinal  pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors,"Purpose: The primary origin of neuroendocrine tumor metastases can be difficult to determine by histopathology alone, but is critical for therapeutic decision making. DNA methylation-based profiling is now routinely used in the diagnostic workup of brain tumors. This has been enabled by the availability of cost-efficient array-based platforms. We have extended these efforts to augment histopathological diagnosis in neuroendocrine tumors. 
Experimental Design and Results: We compiled data of 69 small-intestinal, pulmonary, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. These data were used to build a ridge regression calibrated random forest classification algorithm (NEN-ID) that predicts the origin of tumor samples with high accuracy (&amp;gt; 95%). The model was validated during 3x3 nested cross validation and tested in a local (n=26) and external (n=172) cohort. In addition, we show that our diagnostic approach is robust across a range of possible confounding experimental parameters such as tumor purity and array quality. A software infrastructure and online user interface was built to make the model available to the scientific community.
Conclusions: This DNA methylation-based prediction model can be used in the workup for patients with neuroendocrine tumors of unknown primary. To facilitate validation and clinical implementation, we provide a user-friendly, publicly available web-based version of NEN-ID."

However, what determines the spatial distribution of T cells in the tumour microenvironment is not well understood. Coupling digital pathology and transcriptome analysis on a large ovarian tumour cohort, we develop a machine learning approach to molecularly classify and characterize tumour-immune phenotypes. Our study identifies two important hallmarks characterizing T cell excluded tumours: 1) loss of antigen presentation on tumour cells and 2) upregulation of TGFb and activated stroma. Furthermore, we identify TGFb as a key mediator of T cell exclusion. TGFb reduces MHC-I expression in ovarian cancer cells in vitro; TGFb also activates fibroblasts and induced extracellular matrix (ECM) production as a potential physical barrier to hinder T cell infiltration. Our findings indicate that targeting TGFb may represent a promising strategy to overcome T cell exclusion and improve clinical benefits of cancer immunotherapy."

One of the mechanisms contributing to such a risk is a postnatal intermittent or sustained systemic inflammation (ISSI) following FIR. The link between prenatal and postnatal systemic inflammation is supported by the presence of well‐established inflammatory biomarkers in the umbilical cord and peripheral blood. However, the extent of molecular changes contributing to this association is unknown. Using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry proteomics, we profiled the transcriptome and proteome of archived neonatal dried blood spot (DBS) specimens from 21 ELGANs. Comparing FIR‐affected and unaffected ELGANs, we identified 782 gene and 27 protein expression changes of 50% magnitude or more, and an experiment‐wide significance level below 5% false discovery rate. These expression changes confirm the robust postnatal activation of the innate immune system in FIR‐affected ELGANs and reveal for the first time an impairment of their adaptive immunity. In turn, the altered pathways provide clues about the molecular mechanisms triggering ISSI after FIR, and the onset of perinatal brain injury."

In NABUCCO (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03387761), a single-arm feasibility trial, twenty-four stage III urothelial cancer patients received 2 doses of ipilimumab and 2 doses of nivolumab, followed by resection. The primary endpoint was feasibility to resect &lt;12 weeks from treatment start. All patients were evaluable for the study endpoints and underwent resection; twenty-three (96%) within &lt;12 weeks. Grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events occurred in 55% of patients; 41% when excluding clinically insignificant laboratory abnormalities. 46% of patients had a pathological complete response (pCR), meeting the secondary efficacy endpoint. Fourteen patients (58%) had no remaining invasive disease (pCR or pTisN0/pTaN0). In contrast to studies with anti-PD1/PD-L1 monotherapy, complete response to ipilimumab plus nivolumab was independent of baseline CD8+ presence or T-effector signatures. Induction of TLS upon treatment was observed in responding patients. Our data indicate that combined CTLA-4 plus PD-1 blockade may provide an effective preoperative treatment strategy in locoregionally advanced UC, irrespective of pre-existing CD8+ T-cell activity"

We describe here the first report that has investigated a role for THC and CBD in paediatric brain cancer. Cannabinoids had cytotoxic activity against medulloblastoma and ependymoma cells in vitro, functioning in part through the inhibition of cell cycle progression and the induction of autophagy. Despite these effects in vitro, when tested in orthotopic mouse models of medulloblastoma or ependymoma, no impact on animal survival was observed. Furthermore, cannabinoids neither enhanced nor impaired conventional chemotherapy in a medulloblastoma mouse model. These data show that while THC and CBD do have some effects on medulloblastoma and ependymoma cells, are well tolerated and have minimal adverse effects, they do not appear to elicit any survival benefit in preclinical models of paediatric brain cancer."

Combination strategies attempting to overcome resistance to endocrine therapy such as targeting the PI3 kinase pathway are gaining importance. The phase III SOLAR-1 trial demonstrated the benefit of the addition of alpelisib to fulvestrant, thereby providing further clinical evidence of the increasing importance of PIK3CA testing. Here, we performed a comparison of liquid biopsy and tissue-based detection of PIK3CA mutations in HR-positive metastatic breast cancer patients. Plasma samples and the latest available tumor tissue from 69 patients with metastatic hormone-receptor positive breast cancer were analyzed for PIK3CA hotspot mutations. A high-resolution NGS assay (SiMSen-Seq) was used for plasma samples covering 11 recurrent PIK3CA mutations, used for stratification in SOLAR-1. Additionally, mFAST-SeqS was used to estimate the tumor fractions in the plasma samples. For tumor tissue samples, targeted Ion Torrent NGS was employed. Matched tissue and plasma samples were available from 63 patients. PIK3CA mutations were detected in 46.1% of the tissue samples and in 50.7% of the plasma samples. The variant allele frequency (VAF) ranged from 4.36% to 72.93% with a median of 28.60% in tissue samples, and from 0.28% to 49.85% with a median of 1.17% in plasma samples. The most frequent variants in tissue and plasma were H1047R, E545K, and E542K. We detected at least one of 11 PIK3CA mutations from the SOLAR-1 trial in 51/63 patients, both in tissue and plasma. In 7 patients, such mutations were found only in plasma. In 5 patients, PIK3CA mutations found in tissue were not detectable in ctDNA, 2 of which had a low tumor fraction.Together, in 33/67 plasma samples without detectable PIK3CA mutations, 18 samples had elevated tumor fraction, implicating true negative results. In the remaining 15 patients with low tumor fraction, additional tissue analysis was needed. SiMSen-Seq-based detection of PIK3CA mutations in plasma shows advantageous concordance with the tissue analyses. A combination with an untargeted, mutation-independent approach for detecting ctDNA fractions may confirm a negative PIK3CA result and thereby enhance the performance of the SiMSen-Seq test. This combinatory approach for selecting suitable patients for alpelisib treatment should be validated in larger patient cohorts."

Combining whole-genome sequencing (WGS), targeted amplicon sequencing (tNGS) and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) of tumours from 47 cases of EBV+ DLBCL we delineate the genomic landscape of this rare disease.
Interrogating WGS data by sequential gene-set enrichment and network-diffusion we describe an accumulation of mutations affecting the nuclear factor κB (NFκB) pathway (CSNK2A2, CARD10), IL-6/JAK/STAT (SOCS1/3, STAT3) and WNT signalling (FRAT1, SFRP5) alongside aberrations in immunological processes like interferon-response. Further, WGS uncovered structural aberrations including 6q deletions (5/8 patients), which were subsequently validated by FISH (14/32 cases). Integrated WGS and tNGS analysis emphasized a profile distinct from EBV-negative DLBCL enriched for mutations in ARID1A (45%), KMT2A/D (32/30%), ANKRD11 (32%), NOTCH2 (32%). Expanding on previous reports, we identified recurrent alterations in CCR6 (15%), DAPK1 (15%), TNFRSF21 (13%), CCR7 (11%) and YY1 (6%). 
Our comprehensive description of the mutational landscape in EBV+ DLBCL substantiates the evidence of its pathobiological independence. Further, these observations aid in the refinement of the molecular taxonomy for aggressive lymphomas and guides future therapeutic strategies."

The present study compares the diagnostic yield obtained by aCGH and clinical exome sequencing in NDD globally and its spectrum of disorders. To that end, 1412 patients clinically diagnosed with NDDs and studied with aCGH were classified into phenotype categories: Global developmental delay/intellectual disability (GDD/ID); autism spectrum disorder (ASD); and Other NDDs. These categories were further subclassified into subcategories, based on the most frequent accompanying signs and symptoms: isolated forms, forms with epilepsy; forms with micro or macrocephaly and syndromic forms. A subset of 245 patients of the 1412 were subjected to clinical exome sequencing. Diagnostic yield of aCGH and clinical exome sequencing, expressed as the number of solved cases, was compared for each phenotype category and subcategory. Clinical exome sequencing was superior than aCGH for all cases except for isolated ASD, with no cases solved by NGS. Globally, clinical exome sequencing solved 20% of cases (versus 5.7% by aCGH) and the diagnostic yield was highest for all forms of GDD/ID and lowest for Other NDDs (7.1% versus 1.4% by aCGH) and ASD (6.1% versus 3% by aCGH). In the majority of cases, diagnostic yield was higher in the phenotype subcategories than in the mother category. These results support the use of NGS as the first-tier test in the diagnostic algorithm of all NDDs followed by aCGH when necessary."

Phenotypic differences were identified for human BMPC depending on CD19 expression. Since CD19 is a co-stimulatory molecule of the B-cell-receptor (BCR), and IgA+ and IgM+ BMPC express the BCR on their surface, we here studied whether CD19 expression affects cellular responses, such as BCR signaling and the expression of checkpoint molecules. We analyzed 132 BM samples from individuals undergoing routine total hip arthroplasty. We found that both CD19+ and CD19- BMPC expressed BCR signaling molecules. Notably, the BCR-associated kinase spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) including pSYK was higher expressed in CD19+BMPC compared to CD19- BMPC. BCR stimulation also resulted in increased kinase phosphorylation downstream of the BCR while expression of CD19 remained stable afterwards. Interestingly, the BCR response was restricted to IgA+ BMPC independently of CD19 expression. With regard to the expression of checkpoint molecules, CD19- BMPC expressed higher levels of co-inhibitory molecule programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) than CD19+ BMPC. IgA+ BMPC characteristically upregulated PD-1 upon BCR stimulation in contrast to other PC subsets and inhibition of the kinase SYK abrogated PD-1 upregulation. In contrast, expression of PD-1 ligand, B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) and CD28 did not change upon BCR activation of IgA+ BMPC. Here, we identify a distinct functiotype of IgA+ BMPC that is independent of the phenotypic heterogeneity of the subsets according to their CD19 expression. The data suggest that IgA+ BMPC underlie different regulatory principles and/or exert distinct regulatory functions."

We found that time in the intensive care unit and the type of oxygen support explained the most variation within the upper respiratory tract microbiome, dwarfing (non-significant) effects from viral load, disease severity, and immune status. Specifically, mechanical ventilation was linked to altered community structure, lower species- and higher strain-level diversity, and significant shifts in oral taxa previously associated with COVID-19."

In depth characterization of chromatin accessibility in GSCs identifies three GSC states: Reactive, Constructive, and Invasive, each governed by uniquely essential transcription factors and present within GBMs in varying proportions. Orthotopic xenografts reveal that GSC states associate with survival, and identify an invasive GSC signature predictive of low patient survival. Our chromatin-driven characterization of GSC states improves prognostic precision and identifies dependencies to guide combination therapies."

However, due to technological challenges associated with DNA methylation sequencing in low input cfDNA samples, most studies have been limited by DNA damage caused by bisulfite sequencing, or the qualitative nature of enrichment-based sequencing. Recently, we developed TET-assisted Pyridine Borane Sequencing (TAPS), which is a mild, bisulfite-free method for base-resolution direct DNA methylation sequencing. Here we optimized TAPS for cfDNA (cfTAPS) to provide high-quality and high-depth whole-genome cell-free methylomes. We applied cfTAPS to 85 cfDNA samples from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and non-cancer controls. From just 10 ng cfDNA (1-3 mL of plasma), we generated the most comprehensive cfDNA methylome to date. We demonstrated that cfTAPS provides multimodal information about cfDNA characteristics, including DNA methylation, tissue of origin, and DNA fragmentation. Integrated analysis of these epigenetic and genetic features enables accurate identification of early HCC and PDAC."
EGAS00001005876,comprehensive characterization  pre  post treatment samples  breast cancer reveal potential mechanisms  chemotherapy resistance,"When locally advanced breast cancer is treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the recurrence risk is significantly higher if no complete pathologic response is achieved. Identification of the underlying resistance mechanisms is essential to select treatments with maximal efficacy and minimal toxicity. Here we employed gene expression profiles derived from 317 HER2-negative treatment-naïve breast cancer biopsies of patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy, deep whole exome and RNA-sequencing profiles of 22 matched pre- and post-treatment tumors, and treatment outcome data to identify biomarkers of response and resistance mechanisms. Molecular profiling of treatment-naïve breast cancer samples revealed that expression levels of proliferation, immune response and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization combined predict response to chemotherapy. Triple negative patients with high proliferation, high immune response and low ECM expression had a significantly better treatment response and survival benefit (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10-0.85; p=0.02), while in ER+ patients the opposite was seen (HR 4.73, 95% CI 1.51-14.8; 0=0.008). The characterization of paired pre-and post-treatment samples revealed that aberrations of known cancer genes were either only present in the pre-treatment sample (CDKN1B) or in the post-treatment sample(TP53, APC, CTNNB1). Proliferation-associated genes were frequently down-regulated in post-treatment ER+ tumors, but not in triple negative tumors. Genes involved in ECM were upregulated in the majority of post-chemotherapy samples. Genomic and transcriptomic differences between pre- and post-chemotherapy samples are common and may reveal potential mechanisms of therapy resistance. Our results show a wide range of distinct, but related mechanisms, with a prominent role for proliferation- and ECM-related genes."
EGAS00001003746,integrative genomic analysis identifies key pathogenic mechanisms  primary mediastinal large  cell lymphoma,"Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) represents a clinically and pathologically distinct subtype of large B-cell lymphomas. Furthermore, molecular studies, including global gene expression profiling, have provided evidence that PMBL is more closely related to classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Although targeted sequencing studies have revealed a number of mutations involved in PMBL pathogenesis, a comprehensive description of disease-associated genetic alterations and perturbed pathways is still lacking.  Here, we performed whole-exome sequencing of 95 PMBL tumors to inform on oncogenic driver genes and recurrent copy number alterations. The integration of somatic gene mutations with gene expression signatures provides further insights into genotype-phenotype interrelation in PMBL.  We identified highly recurrent oncogenic mutations in the JAK-STAT and NF-kB pathways, and provide additional evidence of the importance of immune evasion in PMBL (CIITA, CD58, B2M, CD274, PDCD1LG2). Our analyses highlight the IRF-pathway as a putative novel hallmark with frequent alterations in multiple pathway members (IRF2BP2, IRF4, IRF8). In addition, our integrative analysis illustrates the importance of JAK1, RELB and EP300 mutations driving oncogenic signaling.  The identified driver genes were significantly more frequently mutated in PMBL as compared to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, whereas only a limited number of genes were significantly different between PMBL and cHL, emphasizing the close relationship between these entities. Our study, performed on a large cohort of PMBL, highlights the importance of distinctive genetic alterations for disease taxonomy with relevance for diagnostic work-up and therapeutic decision-making."
EGAS00001004867,targeted de methylation   foxp3 tsdr,"CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are key mediators of immunological tolerance and promising effector cells for immuno-suppressive adoptive cellular therapy to fight autoimmunity and chronic inflammation. Their functional stability is critical for their clinical utility and has been correlated to the demethylated state of the TSDR/CNS2 enhancer element in the Treg lineage transcription factor FOXP3. However, proof for a causal contribution of the TSDR de-methylation to FOXP3 stability and Treg induction is so far lacking. We here established a powerful transient-transfection CRISPR-Cas9-based epigenetic-editing method for the selective de-methylation of the TSDR within the endogenous chromatin environment of a living cell. The induced de-methylated state was stable over weeks in clonal T cell proliferation cultures even after expression of the editing complex had ceased. Epigenetic editing of the TSDR resulted in FOXP3 expression, even in its physiological isoform distribution, proving a causal role for the de-methylated TSDR in FOXP3 regulation. However, successful FOXP3 induction was not associated with a switch towards a functional Treg phenotype, in contrast to what has been reported from FOXP3 overexpression approaches. Thus, TSDR de-methylation is required, but not sufficient for a stable Treg phenotype induction. Therefore, targeted demethylation of the TSDR may be a critical addition to published in vitro Treg induction protocols which so far lack FOXP3 stability."

Paired exomes of 21 GZL and 7 poly-EBV-L cases were analyzed as a discovery cohort followed by targeted sequencing of 217 genes in an extension cohort of 29 GZL and 13 poly-EBV-L cases. GZL cases with thymic niche involvement displayed a mutation profile closely resembling cHL and PMBCL, with SOCS1 (45%), B2M (45%), TNFAIP3 (35%), GNA13 (35%) and NFKBIA (29%) being the most recurrently mutated genes. In contrast, GZL cases without thymic niche involvement (N=18) had a significantly distinct pattern, enriched in mutations related to apoptosis defects (TP53 (39%), BCL2 (28%), BIRC6 (22%)) and depleted in GNA13, XPO1 or NFKB signaling pathway mutations (TNFAIP3, NFKBIE, IKBKB, NFKBIA). Poly-EBV-L cases presented a distinct mutational profile including STAT3, PRKDC mutations and a significantly lower coding-mutation load in comparison to EBV-negative GZL.

EGAS00001004947,genetic insights   biological mechanisms governing human ovarian ageing,"Reproductive longevity is critical for fertility and impacts healthy ageing in women, yet insights into the underlying biological mechanisms and treatments to preserve it are limited. Here, we identify 290 genetic determinants of ovarian ageing, assessed using normal variation in age at natural menopause (ANM) in ~200,000 women of European ancestry. These common alleles influence clinical extremes of ANM; women in the top 1% of genetic susceptibility have an equivalent risk of premature ovarian insufficiency to those carrying monogenic FMR1 premutations. Identified loci implicate a broad range of DNA damage response (DDR) processes and include loss-of-function variants in key DDR genes. Integration with experimental models demonstrates that these DDR processes act across the life-course to shape the ovarian reserve and its rate of depletion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that experimental manipulation of DDR pathways highlighted by human genetics increase fertility and extend reproductive life in mice. Causal inference analyses using the identified genetic variants indicates that extending reproductive life in women improves bone health and reduces risk of type 2 diabetes, but increases risks of hormone-sensitive cancers. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms governing ovarian ageing, when they act across the life-course, and how they might be targeted by therapeutic approaches to extend fertility and prevent disease."

In the remaining 15 patients with low tumor fraction, additional tissue analysis was needed. SiMSen-Seq-based detection of PIK3CA mutations in plasma shows advantageous concordance with the tissue analyses. A combination with an untargeted, mutation-independent approach for detecting ctDNA fractions may confirm a negative PIK3CA result and thereby enhance the performance of the SiMSen-Seq test. This combinatory approach for selecting suitable patients for alpelisib treatment should be validated in larger patient cohorts."
EGAS00001000995,mcgill epigenomics mapping centre,"The McGill Epigenomics Mapping Centre (EMC) and Data Coordination Centre (EDCC) were established in 2012 at the McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre (Montreal, Canada) to support large-scale human epigenome mapping for a broad spectrum of cell types and diseases. Previous epigenetic studies have provided profiles of specific chromatin marks in relation to basic biological processes, and future studies of molecular mechanisms must build upon these proofs-of-concept by integrating sequence-based variation with multiple levels of epigenetic and transcriptional regulation across the genome of human tissues and animal disease models. This project leverages the high-throughput sequencing infrastructure and expertise in genomics and transcriptomics at the McGill Innovation Centre to carry out this research. Controlled access to the data by collaborators and the greater scientific community is gained via a portal, which takes advantage of Compute Canada high-performance computing cluster resources to manage the large volume of data associated from the generation of reference epigenome maps.            McGill University is one of two Canadian mapping and data coordination centres, the other based at the Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre in Vancouver, British Columbia. The generation of comprehensive epigenome maps at McGill University is part of a larger international effort that is coordinated by the International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC), whose overall long-term objective is to determine the extent to which the epigenome shapes human populations over generations and in response to the environment.            This project is funded under the Canadian Epigenetics, Environment, and Health Research Consortium (CEEHRC) by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and by Genome Quebec, with additional support from Genome Canada. The computing and networking infrastructure, and part of the software development, are provided by Compute Canada and CANARIE."

Through the multi-centre prospective cohort study, Renal TRACERx Renal, we analysed 1209 primary tumour regions from 101 patients with ccRCC. We detect up to 30 driver events in a single tumour, and show that subclonal diversification is associated with known clinical parameters. Defining driver event co-occurrence, mutual exclusivity and timing at clone level, we reveal deterministic patterns of clonal evolution and disease progression. We find that ccRCC can be grouped into seven distinct evolutionary subtypes, ranging from tumours characterised by early fixation of multiple mutational and copy number driver events that can disseminate widely and rapidly; to highly branched tumours with &gt;10 subclonal drivers and extensive parallel evolution presenting with oligometastatic disease. We identify either heterogeneity or chromosome instability, or both, as determinants of patient outcome.  Our insights reconcile the variable clinical behaviour of ccRCC and the benefit of surgical intervention in early and late-stage disease; and offer potential biomarker opportunities to maximise the benefit of both surgery and active surveillance."

We performed whole-exome sequencing in a well-characterized sample of 14 matched EP tumour/healthy surrounding tissue samples. Mutational profiling revealed a high overall median mutation rate. This was attributed to signatures of mutational processes related to ultraviolet (UV) exposure, APOBEC enzyme dysregulation, and defective homologous double-strand break repair. All of these processes cause genomic instability and are implicated in carcinogenesis. The analyses revealed alterations in the cancer driver genes and in crucial oncogenic pathways."

Previous studies have uncovered gene expression profiles of several kidney glomerular cell types, however, important cells, including mesangial (MCs) and glomerular parietal epithelial cells (PECs), were missing or incompletely described, and a systematic comparison between mouse and human kidney is lacking. To this end, we used Smart-seq2 to profile 4332 individual glomerulus-associated cells isolated from human living donor renal biopsies and mouse kidney. The analysis revealed genetic programs for all four glomerular cell types (podocytes, glomerular endothelial cells, MCs and PECs) as well as rare glomerulus-associated macula densa cells (MDCs). Importantly, we detected heterogeneity in glomerulus-associated Pdgfrb-expressing cells, including bona fide intraglomerular MCs with the functionally active phagocytic molecular machinery, as well as a unique mural cell type located in the central stalk region of the glomerulus tuft. Furthermore, we observed remarkable species differences in the individual gene expression profiles of defined glomerular cell types that highlight translational challenges in the field and provide a guide to design translational studies."
EGAS00001004955,single nuclei rnaseq  normal human choroid  uveal melanoma,"The normal counterparts of choroidal uveal melanoma cells are the melanocytes residing in choroid layer of the eye. The absence of reliable melanocytic cell surface markers prevents direct sorting of live cells with a simple staining method. In addition, melanin absorbs more efficiently light at the UV-Violet range, and in contrast it autofluoresces at the red-near infrared range. This presents unique challenges for the isolation of melanocytes by flow cytometry, which prevents comparison of transcriptomic profiles of normal choroid melanocytes versus uveal melanoma.
Using single-nuclei RNAseq on cell suspensions of normal choroid samples obtained from enucleation surgeries at Institut Curie, we have shown that melanocytes comprise up to 20% of the cells. The remaining cells comprised of a complex combination of fibroblasts, leukocytes, schwann-like cell, endothelial cells, photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium cells.

EGAS00001004829,scrna seq  hgsc tumor  ascites,"Immune regulatory metabolites are key features of the tumor microenvironment (TME), yet with a few notable exceptions, their identities remain largely unknown. We uncovered the immune regulatory metabolic states and metabolomes of sorted tumor and stromal, CD4+, and CD8+ cells from the tumor and ascites of patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) using high-dimensional flow cytometry and metabolomics supplemented with single cell RNA sequencing. Flow cytometry revealed that tumor cells show a consistently greater uptake of glucose than T cells, but similar mitochondrial activity. Cells within the ascites and tumor had pervasive metabolite differences, with a striking enrichment in 1-methylnicotinamide (MNA) in T cells infiltrating the tumor compared to ascites. Despite the elevated levels of MNA in T cells, the expression of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase, the gene encoding the enzyme that catalyses the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to nicotinamide, was restricted to fibroblasts and tumor cells. Treatment of T cells with MNA resulted in an increase in T cell-mediated secretion of the tumor promoting cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha. Thus, the TME-derived metabolite MNA contributes to an alternative and non-cell autonomous mechanism of immune modulation of T cells in HGSC. Collectively, uncovering the tumor-T cell metabolome may reveal metabolic vulnerabilities that can be exploited using T cell-based immunotherapies to treat human cancer."

EGAS00001004991,hla diversity  african populations,"Very little is known about the genetic diversity of the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region in African populations, and the availability of sequences from African individuals from this region are limited in existing HLA databases. Given the importance of these regions in immune response to disease and the complex environments in which the different populations in Africa have evolved, it is vital to understand the diversity of this region among different populations within the African continent. Understanding this diversity is likely to provide important insights into selective adaptation to environment; differences in population disease susceptibility; and yield a useful resource for imputation, allowing greater resolution in GWAS of relevant traits. Undertaking an assessment of HLA genetic diversity in Africa may also be clinically relevant by providing better resolution of HLA types for transplant matching, vital for the operation of transplantation services within this region. Deconvolution of HLA haplotypes within these populations is difficult because of the limitations of existing methods, specifically their lack of resolution given the high variability of this region, and the absence of sequences from African populations in current references, making it difficult to delineate the haplotypes of these alleles in African populations.                                                                                                                                                                                     We recently carried out a pilot study of 125 individuals belonging to five distinct African ethno-linguistic groups from North, East, West and South Africa. Given the high genetic diversity in this region, and known difficulties with resolving ambiguous information in this region, we compared the current clinical gold standard for HLA typing (Sequence Based Typing, SBT, using capillary sequencing) with various emerging sequencing platforms, including single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing (PacBio) and HiSeq X sequencing. Our preliminary findings from 125 samples showed extensive diversity in HLA alleles among African samples, with a large proportion of alleles present in our data being completely absent among Europeans. Our preliminary results from 4 pilot samples that were sequenced with PacBio (GenDX primers) suggest material gains in identification of HLA alleles with six novel alleles (not previously reported in the IGMT database) identified among HLA class I, even in this limited number of samples. Furthermore, we observed marked ambiguity in the SBT calls (&gt;90% of HLA-C alleles), particularly for class I alleles suggesting that alternative methods may be required to explore this region in African populations. Correlation of HLA types between HiSeq X short read sequencing and SBT, the current clinical gold standard, were also poor, consistent with the known variability in this region, and poor reference sequences potentially resulting in poor mapping to these contigs across the genome. In the context of these preliminary findings, here we request funds to expand this study to PacBio sequencing of 5 populations of 25 individuals each, in order to characterise in detail the genetic diversity of this region. In addition to providing the first assessment of genetic diversity of this region in African populations, this will provide a global resource for researchers examining the HLA region in the context of disease susceptibility and response.

Unsupervised analyses of protein abundance data revealed independent clustering of an enriched stroma and enriched tumor epithelium, with whole tumor tissue clustering driven by overall tumor “purity.” Comparing these data to previously defined prognostic HGSOC molecular subtypes revealed protein and transcript expression from tumor epithelium correlated with the differentiated subtype, whereas stromal proteins (and transcripts) correlated with the mesenchymal subtype. Protein and transcript abundance in the tumor epithelium and stroma exhibited decreased correlation in samples collected just hundreds of microns apart. These data reveal substantial tumor microenvironment protein heterogeneity that directly bears on prognostic signatures, biomarker discovery, and cancer pathophysiology and underscore the need to enrich cellular subpopulations for expression profiling.

We also found a variety of innate and adaptive immune cells in normal prostate that were transcriptionally perturbed in prostate cancer. An exception was a unique, prostate-specific, zinc transporter-expressing macrophage population (MAC-MT), that contributed to tissue zinc accumulation in homeostasis, but showed enhanced inflammatory gene expression in tumours, including T cell-recruiting chemokines.

Here, using an ex vivo cellular model that captures natural variation in the transcriptional responses of monocytes to IAV, we find significant differences in viral mRNA levels between individuals of African and European ancestry. Using single cell analyses, we show that the overall number of cells that will ultimately become infected, rather than the amount of viral transcript expression per cell, is the main driver of the surprisingly higher IAV mRNA levels detected in European cells. Finally, we identify 135 genes, including the interferon-stimulated genes IFITM3, MX1, and OAS3, for which basal mRNA expression levels associate with IAV mRNA levels post infection. Our findings reveal that basal differences in activation of IRF/STAT-induced antiviral mechanisms may contribute to individual and population disparities in susceptibility to IAV infection."

High incidence of multiple myeloma (MM) and precursor conditions has been reported among first responders to the WTC disaster. To expand on our prior screening studies, and to characterize the genomic impact of the exposure to known and potential carcinogens in the WTC debris, we were motivated to perform whole genome sequencing (WGS) of WTC first responders and recovery workers who developed a plasma cell disorder after the attack. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed WGS of 9 CD138-positive bone marrow mononuclear samples from patients who were diagnosed with plasma cell disorders after the WTC disaster. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in comparing the post-WTC driver and mutational signatures landscape with 110 previously published WGS from 56 patients with MM and the CoMMpass WGS cohort (n=752). Leveraging constant activity of the single base substitution mutational signatures 1 and 5 over time, we estimated that tumor-initiating chromosomal gains were windowed to both pre- and post-WTC exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Although limitations in sample size preclude any definitive conclusions, our findings suggest that the observed increased incidence of plasma cell neoplasms in this population is due to complex and heterogeneous effects of the WTC exposure that may have initiated or contributed to progression of malignancy."

Different patterns of somatic mutation are generated by the different environmental, lifestyle and genetic factors that cause cancer, many of them are still unknown. Within Mutographs, Kings College London will characterise the mutational signatures induced by putative human carcinogens in order to identify the origins of mutational signatures found in human cancers. To achieve this human organoid cell cultures will be exposed to a representative catalogue of known or suspected human carcinogens and mutagens and, using whole genome sequencing, the patterns of mutations induced by them will be determined. Somatic mutational signatures will be subsequently extracted by non-negative matrix factorisation methods and correlated with exposure data.

EGAS00001003847,longitudinal profiling   immune response  plasmodium vivax  naive hosts  rna sequencing,"Plasmodium vivax offers unique challenges for control and elimination, and may prove a tougher hurdle to overcome than Plasmodium falciparum. And yet compared to P. falciparum we know very little about the innate and adaptive immune responses that need to be harnessed to reduce disease and transmission. We recently generated a blood bank of a new clonal field isolate of P. vivax (PvW1) for human challenge studies and used systems immunology tools to track the host response throughout infection and convalescence. As part of this study, RNA-sequencing was used to resolve changes in whole blood gene expression through time in 6 volunteers (7-9 time-points per volunteer). In summary, these data show that P. vivax induces two distinct transcriptional programmes in whole blood during and after infection. During infection, transcriptional profiling reveals the rapid mobilisation of an emergency myeloid response, which leads to systemic inflammation and the recruitment of all major T cell subsets into lymphoid tissues. Six days after infection, this innate response subsides and a transcriptional signature of proliferation is revealed. This most likely represents widespread activation of lymphocytes, which return to the circulation after parasite clearance - transcriptional profiling of T cells at this time-point could therefore reveal the outcomes of critical cell-cell interactions that take place within the spleen during infection.

Using transcriptomic analysis of 891 NSCLC tumors from patients treated with either the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab or chemotherapy from two large randomized clinical trials, we found a significant B cell association with extended OS with PD-L1 blockade, independent of CD8+ T cell signals. We then derived gene signatures corresponding to the dominant B cell subsets present in NSCLC from single-cell RNA-seq data. Importantly, we found increased plasma cell signatures to be predictive of OS in patients treated with atezolizumab, but not chemotherapy. B cells were also associated with the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures and organized lymphoid aggregates. Our results suggest an important contribution of B and plasma cells to PD-L1 blockade efficacy in NSCLC."

EGAS00001003602,gdap genome diversity  africa project,"The Genomic Diversity in Africa Project (GDAP) started with the plan to develop a genomic resource from African populations, characterise genomic diversity and population history, and facilitate clinical studies in Africa. Currently, 25 individuals from 24 ethnolinguistic groups have been whole-genome sequenced at high depth totalling 585 individuals. An additional 41 individuals have been sequenced with 10X Genomics libraries. At this stage, the initial curation of this dataset has been finished and we are performing the analysis in coordination with our collaborators. The current state of the GDAP represents a very diverse panel of African populations that maximizes geographical and ethnic variation and represents a great starting point to achieve the aforementioned goals. However, southern sub-Saharan countries, Bantu speakers and hunter gatherer groups are currently underrepresented, despite being crucial to understand the evolutionary history of the continent. After extensive effort to collate studies documentation, we finally have the opportunity to sequence 600 new individuals from these groups, including countries as Gabon, Rwanda and Zambia, and address these deficiencies. We aim to proceed with the same strategy: to sequence at high depth 25 individuals with standard PCR free libraries, with 2 additional individuals with 10X Genomics Chromium libraries per ethnolinguistic group. The former allows a good representation of variants down to low frequency in any given population, and the latter allows accurate phasing and the analysis of structural variation. By including these new populations, we want to investigate three crucial questions in African history in addition to the initial objectives: the Bantu expansion, the evolutionary history of hunter gatherers and the transatlantic slave trade. Additionally, the expanded dataset will help us better discover the genetic variation present in Africa and characterize the African pangenome.

We characterize the cellular and molecular heterogeneity within and across patients and delineate the dynamic evolution of tumor and immune cell compartments at single cell resolution in longitudinal specimens from ibrutinib-sensitive patients and non-responders. Temporal activation of multiple cancer hallmark pathways and acquisition of 17q are observed in a refractory MCL. Multi-platform validation is performed at genomic and cellular levels in PDX models and larger patient cohorts. We demonstrate that the molecular targeting of BIRC5/survivin, locates at 17q and upregulates in resistant MCL tumor cells, results in marked tumor inhibition in preclinical models. In addition, we discovere notable differences in the tumor microenvironment including progressive dampening of CD8+ T cells and aberrant cell-to-cell communication networks in refractory MCLs.

EGAS00001005018,exome sequencing reveals pathogenic variants    novel candidate genes  severe sperm motility disorders,"STUDY QUESTION: What are the causative genetic variants in patients with male infertility due to severe sperm motility disorders?

SUMMARY ANSWER: We identified high confidence disease-causing variants in multiple genes previously associated with severe sperm motility disorders in 9 out of 21 patients (43%). We also identified variants in novel candidate genes in 8 additional patients (38%).

WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Severe sperm motility disorders are a form of male infertility characterised by vital, but immotile sperm often in combination with a spectrum of structural abnormalities of the sperm flagellum. Examples of this spectrum of disorders include dysplasia of the fibrous sheath / multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (DFS-MMAF) and severe forms of asthenozoospermia associated to non-specific structural defects. These disorders frequently recur in families and may include chronic respiratory disease. As such, genetic causes are suspected and many genes have recently been reported. Currently, depending on the clinical sub-categorisation, up to 50% of causality in patients with severe sperm motility disorders can be explained by pathogenic variants in at least 21 known genes.

STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We performed exome sequencing in patients with severe sperm motility disorders from two different clinics, aiming to identify the underlying genetic defects and establishing a diagnostic yield in both.

PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHOD: Two groups of infertile men, one from Argentina (n= 9) and one from Australia (n=12), with clinically defined sperm motility disorders were included. All patients in the Argentine cohort were diagnosed with DFS-MMAF, based on transmission electron microscopy. Exome sequencing was performed in all 21 patients and variants with an allele frequency of &lt;1% in the gnomAD population were prioritised and interpreted.

MAIN RESULTS AND ROLE OF CHANCE: In 9/21 patients (43%), we identified pathogenic variants in known sperm motility disorder genes: CFAP43 (3 patients); CFAP44 (2 patients), QRICH2 (2 patients), DNAH1 (1 patient) and DNAH6 (1 patient). The diagnostic rate did not differ markedly between the Argentinian and the Australian cohort (44% and 42%, respectively). Furthermore, we identified patients with variants in the novel candidate sperm motility genes CFAP58, DNAH12, DRC1, MDC1, PACRG, SSPL2C and TPTE2. One patient presented with two possibly damaging variants in four candidate genes and it remains unclear which variants were responsible for the severe sperm motility defect in this patient.

LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: In this study, we described patients with potential bi-allelic variants in known and novel candidate genes for severe sperm motility disorders. Due to unavailability of parental DNA, we have not assessed de novo or maternally inherited dominant variants and could not phase the mutations to establish in all cases that the mutations occur on both alleles.

WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results confirm an important role for five known genes for sperm motility and we demonstrate that exome sequencing is an effective method to diagnose patients with severe sperm motility defects (9/21 diagnosed; 43%). Furthermore, our analysis revealed seven novel candidate genes for severe sperm motility disorders. Genome-wide sequencing of additional patient cohorts and re-analysis of exome data of currently unsolved cases may reveal additional variants in these novel candidate genes."

EGAS00001005023,kalirin rac controls nucleokinetic migration  adrn type neuroblastoma,"The migrational propensity of neuroblastoma is affected by cell identity, but the mechanisms behind the divergence remain unknown. Using RNAi and time-lapse imaging, we show that ADRN-type NB cells exhibit RAC1- and kalirin-dependent nucleokinetic (NUC) migration that relies on several integral components of neuronal migration. Inhibition of NUC migration by RAC1 and kalirin-GEF1 inhibitors occurs without hampering cell proliferation and ADRN identity. Using three clinically-relevant expression dichotomies, we reveal that most of up-regulated mRNAs in RAC1- and kalirin-GEF1-suppressed ADRN-type NB cells are associated with low-risk characteristics. The computational analysis shows that, in a context of overall gene set poverty, the upregulomes in RAC1- and kalirin-GEF1-suppressed ADRN-type cells are a batch of AU-rich elements (ARE)-containing mRNAs, which suggests a link between NUC migration and mRNA stability. GSEA-based search for vulnerabilities reveals prospective weak points in RAC1- and kalirin-GEF1-suppressed ADRN-type NB cells, including activities of H3K27- and DNA methyltransferases. Altogether, these data support the introduction of NUC inhibitors into cancer treatment research."
EGAS00001003843,c3 snps  outcome  lung transplantation,"Background: Development of chronic rejection is still a severe problem and causes high mortality rates after lung transplantation (LTx). Complement activation is important in the development of acute rejection (AR) and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, with C3 as a key complement factor. 
Methods: Since a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the C3 gene (rs2230199) is associated with long-term outcome after solid organ transplantation, we investigated this SNP in relation to LTx. In addition, we looked at local production of C3 by analyzing bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of LTx patients using isoelectric focusing (IEF).   
Results: We demonstrated the presence of C3 in BALF and showed that this is produced by the donor lung based on the genotype of SNP rs2230199. We also analyzed donor and patient SNP configurations and observed a significant association between the SNP configuration in patients and episodes of AR during 4-years follow-up. Survival analysis showed a lower AR-free survival in homozygous C3 slow patients (p=0.005). Furthermore, we found a significant association between the SNP configuration in donors and BOS development. Patients receiving a graft from a donor with at least one C3 fast variant for rs2230199 had an inferior BOS-free survival (p=0.044). 
Conclusions: In conclusion, our data indicate local C3 production by donor lung cells. In addition, a single C3 SNP present in recipients affects short-term outcome after LTx, while this SNP in donors has an opposite effect on long-term outcome after LTx. These results could contribute to an improved risk stratification after transplantation."

Neoadjuvant treatment with ipilimumab plus nivolumab at the standard dosing schedule induced pathological responses in a high proportion of patients in two small independent early-phase trials. However, toxicity of the standard ipilimumab plus nivolumab dosing schedule was high, preventing its broader clinical use. The aim of the OpACIN-neo study (NCT02977052) to identify a dosing schedule of ipilimumab plus nivolumab that is less toxic but equally effective. 86 patients with macroscopic stage III melanoma were randomised to one of three dosing schedules: arm A, two cycles of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg plus nivolumab 1 mg/kg once every 3 weeks; arm B, two cycles of ipilimumab 1 mg/kg plus nivolumab 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks; or arm C, two cycles of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks directly followed by two cycles of nivolumab 3mg/kg once every 2 weeks. Within the first 12 weeks, grade 3–4 immune-related adverse events were observed in 12 (40%) of 30 patients in group A, six (20%) of 30 in group B, and 13 (50%) of 26 in group C. Pathological responses occurred in 24 (80%) patients in group A, 23 (77%) in group B, and 17 (65%) in group C. The 2-year estimated relapse-free survival was 84% for all patients, 97% for patients achieving a pathologic response and 36% for nonresponders (p&lt;0.001). High tumor mutational burden (TMB) and high interferon-gamma-related gene expression signature score (IFN-γ score) were associated with pathologic response and low risk of relapse; pathologic response rate (pRR) was 100% in patients with high IFN-γ score/high TMB, patients with high IFN-γ score/low TMB or low IFN-γ score/high TMB had pRRs of 91% and 88%; while patients with low IFN-γ score/low TMB had a pRR of only 39%.

EGAS00001005008,mutations   ras mapk pathway drive replication repair deficient hypermutated tumors  confer sensitivity  mek inhibition,"The RAS/MAPK pathway is an emerging targeted pathway across a spectrum of both adult and pediatric cancers. Typically, this is associated with a single, well-characterized point mutation in an oncogene. Hypermutant tumors which harbor many somatic mutations may obscure the interpretation of such targetable genomic events. We find that replication repair deficient (RRD) cancers which are universally hypermutant and affect children born with RRD cancer predisposition, are enriched for RAS/MAPK mutations (p=10-8). These mutations are not random, exist in subclones, and increase in allelic frequency over time. The RAS/MAPK pathway is activated both transcriptionally and at the protein level in patient derived RRD tumors and these tumors responded to MEK inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of patients with RAS/MAPK hypermutant gliomas reveal durable responses to MEK inhibition. Our observations suggest that hypermutant tumors may be addicted to oncogenic pathways resulting in favorable response to targeted therapies."

In this context, besides the most significant hit (lead SNV) in every trait- or disease-associated locus, the rest of GWAS hits are often marginally reported, examined, or exploited. To interrogate the value of integrating the information provided by the full set of GWAS hits and fine-mapping haplotypes containing these SNVs, here we focused on a locus repeatedly associated with traits of the cardiac electrical conduction system and arrhythmia (SCN5A-SCN10A). We found that the same SNV can exhibit differing associations depending on haplotype.

All cases of MM are preceded by the asymptomatic, non-malignant pre-stage monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Of all MGUS patients, only 1% per year will progress to MM. Despite efforts to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the MGUS-to-MM progression, its pathogenesis still remains largely unknown. Additionally, the genetic profiles of MGUS patients have only been limitedly investigated due to the only incidental finding of MGUS, the difficulties in BM sampling and isolating a sufficient number of aberrant PCs from the BM aspirates of MGUS patients. Consequently, reliable biomarkers to individually predict which MGUS patients will progress to MM and which will not, are lacking.

Lymphomas withgene expression features of PMBL have been described in non-mediastinal sites, raising questions abouthow these tumors should be classified.Here, we investigated whether these ""non-mediastinal PMBLs"" are indeed PMBLs or instead represent adistinct group within DLBCL. From a cohort of 325 de novo DLBCL cases, we identified tumors frompatients without evidence of anterior mediastinal involvement that expressed a PMBL expression signature(nm-PMBLsig-pos, n=16, 5%). The majority of these tumors expressed MAL and CD23 – proteins typicallyobserved in bona fide PMBL (bf-PMBL). Evaluation of clinical features of nm-PMBLsig-pos cases revealedclose associations with DLBCL, and the majority displayed a germinal center B-cell-like cell-of-origin(GCB). In contrast to bf-PMBL, nm-PMBLsig-pos patients presented at an older age, did not show pleuraldisease, and bone/bone marrow involvement was observed in three cases. However, while clinicallydistinct from bf-PMBL, nm-PMBL-sig-pos tumors resembled bf-PMBL at the molecular level with upregulationof immune response, JAK-STAT, and NF-kB signatures. Mutational analysis revealed frequent somatic genemutations in SOCS1, IL4R, ITPKB and STAT6, as well as CD83 and BIRC3, with the latter genes beingsignificantly more frequently affected than in GCB-DLBCL and bf-PMBL.Our data establish nm-PMBLsig-pos lymphomas as a group of DLBCL with distinct phenotypic and geneticfeatures, and potential implications for gene expression- and mutation-based subtyping of aggressive Bcell lymphoma and related targeted therapies."

However, only a minority of patients with FGFR1-amplified tumors respond to single agent inhibitor therapy targeting FGFR. To understand the underlying mechanism of FGFR1 dependency, we performed whole genome and transcriptome sequencing of 25 FGFR1-amplified primary tumors with unknown response upon FGFR inhibition. In addition, we performed deep sequencing of 26 FGFR1-amplified samples whereof the response upon FGFR inhibition was known for 25 samples. In both cohorts we identified intra-chromosomal tail-to-tail breaks close to the FGFR1 transcription start site, being responsible for focal amplification of FGFR1. These specific breaks are caused by a Breakage-Fusion-Bridge-like (BFB-like) mechanism. Here, we associate these breaks with FGFR inhibitor sensitivity. Moreover, in some cases these breaks are located within the open reading frame of FGFR1, which leads to the expression of an ΔEC-FGFR1 transcript that lacks the ecto-domain. Overexpression of ΔEC-FGFR1 transforms Baf3 cells and lead to an FGFR1-dependent phenotype. Our results demonstrate that the truncation of the FGFR1 ectodomain is a frequent event in 8p11.23-amplified squamous cell lung cancer caused by tail-to-tail breaks. These breaks might be used as a predictive therapeutic marker to stratify patients for FGFR-inhibitor therapy."

Two peripheral blood cell types, the CD14+CD16- monocyte (an important central orchestrator of adaptive immunity and a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity) and the CD65+CD9- neutrophilic granulocyte (the frontline cell for innate immunity) have been selected for this purpose.  The two types of cells will be obtained at high purity from adult blood (AB) of 200 healthy males and females, respectively.  Cells will be purified by using already validated and fully operational protocols that are based on density gradient centrifugation of the buffy coat obtained from whole blood, followed by magnetic bead-based purification using monoclonal antibodies against Cluster of Differentiation (CD) lineage-specific cell surface markers.

EGAS00001002523,genome diversity  africa project uganda,"Globally, human populations show structured genetic diversity as a result of geographical dispersion, selection and drift. Understanding this genetic variation can provide insights into the evolutionary processes that shape both human adaptation and variation in disease. Populations from SSA have the highest levels of genetic diversity. This characteristic, in addition to historical genetic admixture, can lead to complexities in the design of studies assessing the genetic determinants of disease and human variation. However, such studies of African populations are also likely to provide new opportunities to discover novel disease susceptibility loci and variants and refine gene–disease association signals. A systematic assessment of genetic diversity within SSA would facilitate genomic epidemiological studies in the region.
The Genome Diversity in Africa Project (GDAP) aims to produce a comprehensive catalogue of human genetic variation in SSA, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), structural variants, and haplotypes. This resource will make a substantial contribution to understanding patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations in SSA, as well as providing a global resource to help design, implement and interpret genomic studies in SSA populations and studies comprising globally diverse populations, complementing existing genomic resources. Specifically, we plan to carry out high depth whole genome sequencing of up to 2000 individuals across Africa (25 individuals from each ethnolinguistic group).
Our scientific objectives are to: 1) develop a resource that provides a comprehensive catalogue of genetic variation in populations from SSA accessible to the global scientific community; 2) characterise population genetic diversity, structure, gene flow and admixture across SSA; 3) develop a cost-efficient, next-generation genotype array for diverse populations across SSA; and 4) facilitate whole genome-sequencing association studies of complex traits and diseases by developing a reference panel for imputation and resource for enhancing fine-mapping disease susceptibility loci. These scientific objectives will be supported by cross-cutting operational activities, including network and management of the consortium, research ethics, and research capacity building in statistical genetics and bioinformatics"

EGAS00001004935,single cell dissection   tumour microenvironment reveals dynamic interplay shaping  tumour immunity continuum  ovarian cancer,"Diverse tumour immune phenotypes with distinct T cell infiltration patterns result in different responses to cancer immunotherapies. However, the key determinants and biology underpinning these phenotypes remain elusive. Here, we provide a high-resolution dissection of the tumour microenvironment representative of different tumour immune phenotypes. By performing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of the tumour, immune, and stromal compartments from 15 ovarian cancer patients, we characterized the diverse cellular and functional phenotypes, as well as dynamic interplay within and between these components. Infiltrated and excluded tumours markedly differed from desert tumours in several tumour cell intrinsic features, including high interferon response, antigen presentation and oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, these tumours were characterized by tumour associated macrophage (TAM)-like myeloid subsets, while desert tumours were enriched in myeloid derived suppressive cell (MDSC)-like myeloid subsets. Infiltrated and excluded tumours differed in their T cell composition and fibroblast subsets. While dysfunctional CD8+ GZMB T cells and IL1-activated fibroblasts (IL1 CAFs) were associated with infiltrated tumours, pre-dysfunctional CD8+ GZMK T cells and TGFB-activated fibroblasts (TGFB CAFs) were enriched in excluded tumours. These findings validated in bulk transcriptomic profiles of 1071 ovarian tumours and using in situ hybridization. Furthermore, our study revealed chemokine receptor-ligand interactions within and across compartments as potential mechanisms mediating immune cell infiltration, exemplified by the tumour cell-T cell crosstalk via a CXC16-CXCR6 axis, stromal-immune cell crosstalk via CXCL12/14-CXCR4 signalling, and TAM-like macrophage-T cell crosstalk through CXCR3-CXCL9/10/11 signalling. Our in-depth characterization of the tumour environment and intercellular interactions provides novel insights into potential molecular mechanisms that shape the distinct biology of tumour immune phenotypes. Our findings may inform novel therapeutic strategies for potentially shifting tumours along the immunity continuum to improve clinical benefit from cancer immunotherapies."
EGAS00001005890,detection  malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors  patients  neurofibromatosis  aneuploidy  mutation identification  plasma,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are the deadliest cancer that arises in individuals diagnosed with neurofibromatosis and account for nearly 5% of the 15,000 soft tissue sarcomas diagnosed in the United States each year. Comprised of neoplastic Schwann cells, primary risk factors for developing MPNST include existing plexiform neurofibromas (PN), prior radiotherapy treatment, and expansive germline mutations involving the entire NF1 gene and surrounding genes. PN develop in nearly 30-50% of patients with NF1 and most often grow rapidly in the first decade of life. One of the most important aspects of clinical care for NF1 patients is monitoring PN for signs of malignant transformation to MPNST that occurs in 10-15% of patients. We perform aneuploidy analysis on ctDNA from 883 ostensibly healthy individuals and 28 patients with neurofibromas, including 7 patients with benign neurofibroma, 9 patients with PN and 12 patients with MPNST. Overall sensitivity for detecting MPNST using genome wide aneuploidy scoring was 33%, and analysis of sub-chromosomal copy number alterations (CNAs) improved sensitivity to 50% while retaining a high specificity of 97%. In addition, we performed mutation analysis on plasma cfDNA for a subset of patients and identified mutations in NF1, NF2, RB1, TP53BP2, and GOLGA2. Given the high throughput and relatively low sequencing coverage required by our assay, liquid biopsy represents a promising technology to identify incipient MPNST."

Identifying the specific genomic alterations driving the progression of normal skin to AK and invasive cSCC is challenging due to the massive, ultraviolet radiation-induced mutational burden characteristic to these lesions. Here, we present the largest whole exome sequencing study to date on AK with matched cSCC and demonstrate that AK and cSCC are almost indistinguishable at the genomic level, in terms of mutational burden, patterns of driver gene mutations and copy number alterations. We identified 44 significantly mutated AK driver genes through our established bioinformatics pipeline and demonstrate these genes are similarly mutated in cSCC. We also identified mutational signature-32 exclusively in AK from patients exposed to azathioprine, providing further, compelling evidence for this drug’s role in keratinocyte carcinogenesis, likely through its blocking of transcription coupled repair. We demonstrated that cSCC had higher levels of intra-sample heterogeneity than AK and that several signaling pathways, including immune-related signaling and TGF-beta signaling were significantly more mutated in cSCC. Integrating our findings with independent gene expression data confirms that dysregulated TGF-beta signaling may represent the critical pathway in the progression from AK to cSCC."

EGAS00001005889,single cell analysis  primary cancer associated fibroblasts  chronic pancreatitis  pancreatic cancer patients,"Cancer-associated fibroblasts, which are derived from several cell types such as pancreatic stellate cells or mesenchymal stem cells, play a major role in the progression and drug resistance of pancreatic cancer. Targeting cancer-associated fibroblasts can be a promising therapeutic strategy. Recent studies suggest that cancer-associated fibroblasts exhibit functional heterogeneity with distinct gene expression profiling in pancreatic cancer, such as myofibroblastic, inflammatory, and antigen-presenting cancer-associated fibroblasts. However, intra-tumoral heterogeneity of cancer-associated fibroblasts in pancreatic cancer patients and their pivotal role in cancer-related mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we used cancer-associated fibroblasts primary isolated from pancreatic cancer patients and chronic pancreatitis patient via outgrowth method to see whether we can detect myofibroblastic, inflammatory, and antigen-presenting cancer-associated fibroblast clusters in patient specimens, and whether we can identify novel cancer-associated fibroblast subtypes potentially associated with pancreatic diseases development or progression."

Here, we developed a quantitative method, exploiting local tissue-specific cell-free DNA (cfDNA) degradation patterns, that accurately estimates ctDNA burden independent of genomic aberrations. Nucleosome-dependent cfDNA degradation at promoters and first exon-intron junctions was strongly associated with differential transcriptional activity in tumors and blood. A quantitative model, based on just 6 regulatory regions, could accurately predict ctDNA levels in colorectal cancer patients. Strikingly, a model restricted to blood-specific regulatory regions could predict ctDNA levels across both colorectal and breast cancer patients."

Here, we report a novel, recessive syndrome associated with PRDM13 mutation. Patients exhibited intellectual disability, ataxia with cerebellar hypoplasia, scoliosis and delayed puberty with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH). Expression studies revealed Prdm13/PRDM13 transcripts in the developing hypothalamus and cerebellum in mouse and human. An analysis of hypothalamus and cerebellum development in mice homozygous for a Prdm13 mutant allele revealed a significant reduction in the number of Kisspeptin (Kiss1) neurons in the hypothalamus and PAX2+ progenitors emerging from the cerebellar ventricular zone. The latter was accompanied by ectopic expression of the glutamatergic lineage marker TLX3. Prdm13-deficient mice displayed cerebellar hypoplasia, normal gonadal structure, but delayed pubertal onset. Together, these findings identify PRDM13 as a critical regulator of GABAergic cell fate in the cerebellum and of hypothalamic kisspeptin neuron development, providing a mechanistic explanation for the co-occurrence of CHH and cerebellar hypoplasia in this syndrome. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence linking disrupted PRDM13-mediated regulation of Kiss1 neurons to CHH in humans."

However, monitoring with FDG-PET/CT, the current response detection standard, is challenging. Here, we address the potential applicability of tissue biomarkers and blood-based biomarkers in PD-1 treated cHL patients. We evaluated 9p24.1/PD-L1/PD-L2 alterations, and expression of PD-L1 and antigen presentation molecules (HLA class I/II) in 9 tissue biopsies of 4 patients. In addition, we assessed circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), extracellular vesicle associated miRNAs (EV-miRNAs), soluble PD-L1 and serum TARC (sTARC) in 26 longitudinal blood samples of these patients during PD-1 treatment. We found that the predictive power of tissue biomarkers is dependent on the timing of the biopsy . The dynamics of blood-based biomarkers: sTARC, EV-miRNAs and ctDNA corresponded well  immunotherapy treatment response. Therefore, blood-based biomarkers are promising monitoring strategies in PD-1 treated cHL patients and should be further explored in clinical trials or observational studies."

Due to a phenotypical resemblance with secondary effusion of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), HHV8-negative EBL is easily misdiagnosed. However, in contrast to DLBCL, HHV8-negative EBL follows a mild clinical course, underpinning the importance to differentiate between the two entities. Only limited molecular data of HHV8-negative EBL has been reported and characteristic genomic patterns are lacking. We performed extensive genomic profiling on 8 HHV8-negative EBL cases. A mean number of 33.6 copy number gains and losses per case were found, with recurrent focal deletions of chromosome 3p14.2 and 6q21 in 6/8 cases, encompassing tumor supressor genes FHIT and PRDM1, respectively. We observed a high rate of mutations across genes frequently involved in DLBCL, including patterns of somatic hypermutation. The most abundant hotspot mutation was found in MYD88L265P (3/8 cases). In addition, 5/8 cases had one or more translocations, involving MYC, BCL2, BCL6, TP63, EXOC2 and KMT2D, with Ig and non-Ig partners. We conclude that HHV8-negative EBL is characterized by genomic features that are commonly found  in more aggressive B-cell lymphomas, but despite this follow an indolent clinical course."

Here, we identify three germline heterozygous missense variants in RPA1 gene in four unrelated probands presenting with short telomeres and varying clinical features of TBD including bone marrow failure, myelodysplastic syndrome, T- and B-cell lymphopenia, pulmonary fibrosis, and skin manifestations. All variants cluster to DNA binding domain A of RPA1 protein. RPA1 is an essential single-strand DNA-binding protein essential for DNA replication and repair. RPA1 has been implicated in telomere maintenance but the mechanism remains elusive. Thus far, no genetic disorder had been linked to RPA1. Using FRET assays, we showed that RPA1E240K and RPA1V227A exhibit increased binding to single-strand and telomeric DNA, implying a gain in DNA-binding function while RPA1T270A has binding properties similar to wild type. To study the mutational effect, RPA1E240K, with the highest binding capacity, was knocked-in iPSCs using CRISPR/Cas9, which showed severe telomere shortening and impaired hematopoietic differentiation. Furthermore, in the RPA1E240K patient, stable blood counts over two decades due coincided with clonal rescue hematopoiesis with an RNA-degrading truncating RPA1 mutation and a uniparental isodisomy 17p with loss of RPA1E240K allele. Using single cell DNA sequencing, the two somatic genetic rescue events were proven to be independently acquired in hematopoietic stem cells. In summary, we describe the first human disease caused by germline RPA1 variants in individuals with TBD."

We show that HeliosI325V retains DNA-binding and dimerization properties, but loses interaction with several partners, including epigenetic remodelers HDAC1, HDAC3 and the ATAC complex. 

Single-cell RNA-sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed gene expression signatures indicative of a shift towards pro-inflammatory, effector-like status in the patient’s T cells.

We observed an upregulation of the anti-inflammatory gene, TSC22D3, encoding the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), whose expression was reported to increase upon IL-2 deprivation. 

We validated this finding in primary T cells, where we observed a pronounced reduction in IL-2 production upon their stimulation, together with a defect in their ability to proliferate, rendering them more anergic. 

Collectively, we identify a novel germline-encoded inborn error of immunity and define a role for Helios in conventional T cells, whereby interactions with specific binding partners is necessary to mediate the transcriptional programs that enable T-cell homeostasis in health and disease."

Although germline mutations in IKZF1 and IKZF3, encoding Ikaros and Aiolos, have recently been identified in patients with phenotypically similar immunodeficiency syndromes, the effect of germline mutations in IKZF2 on human hematopoiesis and immunity remains enigmatic. We identified germline IKZF2 mutations (one nonsense (p.R291X)- and 4 distinct missense variants) in six patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, immune thrombocytopenia or EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Patients exhibited hypogammaglobulinemia, decreased number of T-follicular helper and NKcells. Single-cell RNA sequencing of PBMCs from the patient carrying the R291X variant revealed upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes associated with T-cell receptor activation and T-cell exhaustion. Functional assays revealed the inability of HeliosR291X to homodimerize and bind target DNA as dimers.

EGAS00001005253,combining  universal telomerase based cancer vaccine  ipilimumab  patients  metastatic melanoma  year follow    phase  iia trial,"Background 
Ipilimumab improves survival for patients with metastatic malignant melanoma. Combining a therapeutic cancer vaccine with ipilimumab may increase efficacy by providing enhanced anti-tumor immune responses. UV1 consists of three synthetic long peptides from human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). These peptides comprise epitopes recognized by T cells from cancer patients experiencing long-term survival following treatment with a first-generation hTERT vaccine, and generate long-lasting immune responses in cancer patients when used as monotherapy. The objective of this trial was to investigate the safety and efficacy of combining UV1 with ipilimumab in metastatic melanoma. 
Patients and methods
In this phase I/IIa, single center trial [NCT02275416], patients with metastatic melanoma received repeated UV1 vaccinations, with GM-CSF as an adjuvant, in combination with ipilimumab. Patients were evaluated for safety, efficacy and immune response. Immune responses against vaccine peptides were monitored in peripheral blood by measuring antigen-specific proliferation and IFN-γ production. 
Results
Twelve patients were recruited. Adverse events were mainly diarrhea, injection site reaction, pruritus, rash, nausea and fatigue. Ten patients showed a Th1 immune response to UV1 peptides, occurring early and after few vaccinations. Three patients obtained a partial response and one patient a complete response. Overall survival was 50% at 5 years. 
Conclusion
Treatment was well tolerated. The rapid expansion of UV1-specific Th1 cells in the majority of patients indicates synergy between UV1 vaccine and CTLA-4 blockade.  This may have translated into clinical benefit, encouraging the combination of UV1 vaccination with standard of care treatment regimes containing ipilimumab/CTLA-4 blocking antibodies."

Here we develop a method using whole-exome sequencing (WES) of cfDNA for simultaneously monitoring the full spectrum of cancer treatment outcomes, including MRD, recurrence, evolution, and second primary cancers. Experimental Design: Three simulation datasets were generated from 26 cancer patients to benchmark the detection performance of MRD/recurrence and second primary cancers. For further validation, cfDNA samples (n=76) from cancer patients (n=35) with six different cancer types were used for performance validation during various treatments.Results: We present a cfDNA-based cancer monitoring method, named cfTrack. Taking advantage of the broad genome coverage of WES data, cfTrack can sensitively detect MRD and cancer recurrence by integrating signals across known clonal tumor mutations of a patient. In addition, cfTrack detects tumor evolution and second primary cancers by de novo identifying emerging tumor mutations. A series of machine learning and statistical denoising techniques are applied to enhance the detection power. On the simulation data, cfTrack achieved an average AUC of 99% on the validation dataset and 100% on the independent dataset in detecting recurrence in samples with tumor fraction ≥0.05%. In addition, cfTrack yielded an average AUC of 88% in detecting second primary cancers in samples with tumor fraction ≥0.2%. On real data, cfTrack accurately monitors tumor evolution during treatment, which cannot be accomplished by previous methods.Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that cfTrack can sensitively and specifically monitor the full spectrum of cancer treatment outcomes using exome-wide mutation analysis of cfDNA."
EGAS00001004362,genetic diversity  continuity   population   uae,"With high consanguinity rates on the Arabian Peninsula, it would not have been unexpected if the population of the UAE was shown to be relatively homogenous.  However, this study of 1,000 UAE nationals, provided a contrasting perspective, one of a relatively heterogeneous population. Located at the apex of Europe, Asia and Africa, the observed diversity could be explained by a plethora of migration patterns since the first Out-of-Africa movement. A strategy to explore the extent of genetic variation of the population of the UAE is presented.  The first step involved a comprehensive population stratification study that was instructive for subsequent Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) of suitable representatives (which is described elsewhere). When this UAE data was compared to previous smaller studies from the region, the findings were consistent with a population that is a diverse and admixed group of people.  However, rather than sharp and distinctive clusters, a continuous genotype distribution was observed.  The analysis showed a continuous gradient of ancestral populations, suggesting that admixture on the south eastern tip of Arabian Peninsula occurred gradually.  When visualized using a unique technique that combined admixture ratios and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), unappreciated diversity was revealed while mitigating projection bias of conventional PCA. The analytical strategy used here highlights the complementary nature of data from genotype array and WGS for anthropological studies.  Specifically, genotype array data was instructive to select representative subjects for WGS.  Furthermore, from the 2.3 million allele frequencies obtained from genotype arrays, we identified 46,481 loci with allele frequencies that were significantly different with respect to other world populations. This comparison of allele frequencies facilitates variant prioritization in common diseases. In addition, these loci bear great potential as biomarkers in anthropological and forensic studies."

Identification of the underlying genomic aberrations of “exceptional responders (ExRs)” compared to “rapid non-responders (NR)” increases our understanding of the mechanisms involved in MBC progression and identification of biomarkers of trastuzumab response and resistance. Whole exome sequencing was performed on six ExRs compared to five NR. The overall fraction of genome copy number alteration (CNA) burden was higher in NR patients (P=0.07), while more significantly pronounced in copy number gains (P=0.03) in NR compared to ExRs. Delineation of the distribution of CNA burden across the genome identified a greater degree of CNA burden in NR within chr8 (P=0.02) and in chr17 (P=0.06) and conferred a statistically significant benefit in overall survival."

The purpose of our study was to assess the clinical relevance and development of genome-wide SCNAs in plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) under osimertinib therapy.Methods: We included 43 patients with advanced EGFR T790M-positive lung adenocarcinoma who were treated with osimertinib after progression under previous EGFR-TKI therapy. We performed genomic profiling of ctDNA in plasma samples from each patient obtained pre-osimertinib and after patients developed resistance to osimertinib. SCNAs were detected by shallow whole-genome plasma sequencing and EGFR mutations were assessed by droplet digital PCR.Results: SCNAs in resistance-related genes (rrSCNAs) were detected in 10 out of 39 (25.6%) evaluable patients before start of osimertinib. The presence of rrSCNAs in plasma before initiation of osimertinib therapy was associated with a lower response rate to osimertinib (50% versus 86%, p=0.02) and was an independent predictor for shorter progression-free survival (adjusted HR 3.26, 95% CI 1.37-7.75, p=0.008) and overall survival (adjusted HR 2.41, 95% CI 1.09-5.34, p=0.03).Conclusions: Genomic profiling of plasma ctDNA is clinically relevant and affects the efficacy and clinical outcome of osimertinib.

EGAS00001004734,identification  rare germline variants  familial multiple myeloma,"The risk of developing multiple myeloma (MM) in first-degree relatives of affected individuals is 2 to 4 fold higher than in the general population, implying the existence of inherited susceptibility. While over 20 common, low-penetrance variants have been associated with MM risk, less is known about rare, high-penetrance germline predisposition. We aimed to identify and characterize high/moderated penetrance germline variants in MM families using whole genome sequencing. For that purpose we identified families with at least two individuals diagnosed with MM or its precursors MGUS and smoldering MM. Also, patients with solitary plasmacytoma and AL amyloidosis were enrolled. We also recruited unaffected family members, and they were screened to exclude undetected MM or its precursor stages. After whole genome sequencing of blood DNA and filtering for rare variants (minor allele frequency &lt;0.1%) and family segregation, variants are prioritized by a range of published in silico tools and literature search. The most promising variants are subjected to experimental validation to evaluate their functional relevance. Our data will provide guidance to worldwide efforts to unravel germline predisposition in MM and validation of the proposed variants and genes."
EGAS00001004116,cd8 t cell exhaustion induced  leukemic cells drives progression  chronic lymphocytic leukemia,"In order to shed light on mechanisms that lead to CLL progression, we investigated longitudinal changes in both the genetic and immunological landscapes. For that, we analyzed paired samples obtained from CLL patients at diagnosis and progression before front-line treatment or at diagnosis and long-term asymptomatic follow-up. By whole-exome sequencing (WES), we found that CLL cells displayed limited genetic evolution at progression. Conversely, T cells from progressing patients showed significant immunophenotypical and transcriptional changes over time not observed in patients that did not progress. Specifically, we found that CD8+ T cells at progression were characterized by an increasing terminally exhausted effector phenotype (T-betdim/- Eomeshi PD1hi) with high co-expression of inhibitory receptors (PD1, CD244 and CD160). This exhausted status in CD8+ T cells was induced by progressing leukemic cells mainly through a mechanism dependent on soluble factors, including IL-10.

Here we combine optical mapping and whole genome sequencing to explore in-depth the nature of structural variants (SVs) induced by replication stress in cyclin-activated hepatocellular carcinomas (CCN-HCC). In addition to classical tandem duplications, CCN-HCC display frequent intra- and inter-chromosomal templated insertion cycles (TIC) likely resulting from template switching events. Template switching preferentially involves active topologically associated domains that are close in the 3D genome organization. Template sizes depend on the type of cyclin activation and are coordinated within each TIC. Replication stress induces continuous accumulation of SVs during CCN-HCC progression, fostering the acquisition of new driver alterations and large-scale copy-number changes at TIC borders. Together, this analysis sheds light on the mechanisms, dynamics and consequences of SV accumulation in tumors with oncogene-induced replication stress."

We investigated whether late-stage HGSC has unique genomic characteristics consistent with acquisition of evolutionary advantage compared to early-stage tumours.
Experimental Design: We performed targeted next generation sequencing and shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS) on pre-treatment samples from 43 patients with FIGO stage I–IIA HGSC to investigate somatic mutations and copy number alterations (SCNA). We compared results to pre-treatment samples from 52 stage IIIC/IV HGSC patients from the BriTROC-1 study.
Results: Age of diagnosis did not differ between early-stage and late-stage patients (median 61.3 years vs 62.3 years respectively). TP53 mutations were near-universal in both cohorts (89% early- stage, 100% late-stage) and there were no significant differences in the rates of other somatic mutations, including BRCA1 and BRCA2. We also did not observe cohort-specific focal SCNA that could explain biological behaviour. However, ploidy was higher in late-stage (median 3.0) than early-stage (median 1.9) samples. Copy number (CN) signature exposures were significantly different between cohorts, with greater relative signature 3 exposure in early-stage and greater signature 4 in late-stage. Unsupervised clustering based on CN signatures identified three clusters that were prognostic.
Conclusions: Early stage and late stage HGSC have highly similar patterns of mutation and focal SCNA. However, copy number signature analysis showed that late-stage disease has distinct signature exposures consistent with whole genome duplication. Further analyses will be required to ascertain whether these differences reflect genuine biological differences between early and late-stage or simply time-related markers of evolutionary fitness."
EGAS00001005753,genome wide rare variant score associates  morphological subtypes  autism spectrum disorder,"Defining different genetic subtypes of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can help predict developmental outcomes. Based on minor physical and major congenital anomalies, we categorized 325 Canadian children with ASD into dysmorphic and non-dysmorphic subgroupings. We developed a method to calculate a genome-wide rare variant score (GRVS) from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data for each ASD proband. GRVS is a sum of the number of variants in morphology-associated coding and non-coding regions, weighted by their effect sizes. Probands with dysmorphic ASD had a significantly higher GRVS compared to those with non-dysmorphic ASD (P= 0.027). Using the polygenic transmission disequilibrium test, we observed an over-transmission of ASD-associated common variants in non-dysmorphic ASD probands (P= 2.9×10-3). We replicated our findings using 442 ASD probands that had accompanying morphology data in the Simons Simplex Collection. Our findings provide support for an alternative genomic classification of ASD subgroups using morphology data, which may inform intervention protocols."

Methods: we analyzed the impact of collection tube, plasma processing time and physiology on the size distribution of cfDNA, their genome-wide representation and sequence diversity at the cfDNA fragment-ends using shallow Whole Genome Sequencing. 
Results: we observed that using different stabilizing collection tubes, or processing times does not affect the cfDNA fragment sizes, but can impact the genome-wide fragmentation patterns and fragment-end sequences of cfDNA. In addition, beyond differences depending on the gender, the physiological conditions tested between 63 individuals (age, body mass index, use of medication and chronic conditions) minimally influenced the outcome of fragmentomic methods.
Conclusions: our results highlight that fragmentomic approaches have potential for implementation in the clinic, pending clear traceability of analytical and physiological factors."

Ultimately, it is the patterns of genes that are turned on and off that determines which proteins a cell produces and its biological function. Despite the importance of changes in chromosome number (known as aneuploidy or copy number changes), little is known about how these changes impact patterns of gene expression. This project will aim to fill this gap by creating an atlas of patterns of gene expression in cells from developmental tissues with aberrant numbers of chromosomes. These gene expression profiles will then be compared to the patterns of expression in the same cells with two copies of each chromosome, directly measuring the precise, cell specific, consequences of copy number change on gene expression."

This heterogeneity is one of the main reasons for the poor prognosis and overall survival. Moreover, it raises the important question of whether the molecular characterization of a single bioptic sample, as performed in standard di-agnostics, actually represents the entire lesion.

Integrated genomic analysis of 126 pediatric liver tumors showed a continuum of driver mechanisms associated with patient age, including new targetable oncogenes. In 10% of hepatoblastoma patients, all before 3 years old, we identified a mosaic premalignant clonal expansion of cells altered at the 11p15.5 locus. Analysis of spatial and longitudinal heterogeneity revealed an important plasticity between ‘Hepatocytic’, ‘Liver Progenitor’ and ‘Mesenchymal’ molecular subgroups of hepatoblastoma. We showed that during chemotherapy, ‘Liver Progenitor’ cells accumulated massive loads of cisplatin-induced mutations with a specific mutational signature, leading to the development of heavily mutated relapses and metastases. Drug screening in PLC cell lines identified promising targets for cisplatin-resistant progenitor cells, validated in mouse xenograft experiments. These data provide new insights into cisplatin resistance mechanisms in PLC and suggest alternative therapies."
EGAS00001001751, integrative model  pathway convergence  genetically heterogeneous blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia cml,"Targeted therapies against the BCR-ABL1 kinase have revolutionized treatment of chronic phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In contrast, management of blast crisis (BC) CML remains challenging because BC cells acquire complex molecular alterations that confer stemness features to progenitor populations and resistance to BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Comprehensive models of BC transformation have proved elusive because of the rarity and genetic heterogeneity of BC, but are important for developing biomarkers predicting BC progression and effective therapies. To better understand BC, we performed an integrated multiomics analysis of 74 CP and BC samples using whole-genome and exome sequencing, transcriptome and methylome profiling, and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing. Employing pathway-based analysis, we found the BC genome was significantly enriched for mutations affecting components of the polycomb repressive complex (PRC) pathway. While transcriptomically, BC progenitors were enriched and depleted for PRC1- and PRC2-related gene sets respectively. By integrating our data sets, we determined that BC progenitors undergo PRC-driven epigenetic reprogramming toward a convergent transcriptomic state. Specifically, PRC2 directs BC DNA hypermethylation, which in turn silences key genes involved in myeloid differentiation and tumor suppressor function via so-called epigenetic switching, whereas PRC1 represses an overlapping and distinct set of genes, including novel BC tumor suppressors. On the basis of these observations, we developed an integrated model of BC that facilitated the identification of combinatorial therapies capable of reversing BC reprogramming (decitabine+PRC1 inhibitors), novel PRC-silenced tumor suppressor genes (NR4A2), and gene expression signatures predictive of disease progression and drug resistance in CP."

Existing studies have focused on bulk profiling of mixed cell types, but have ignored assaying genetic effects across development and cell differentiation. At the core of this proposal is the idea to use single-cell assays to study genetic effects during differentiation of dopaminergic and cortical neurons to identify the sequence of molecular events from variants to healthy and diseased cell states in a cell-specific manner.

To unlock liquid biopsy analysis for pediatric tumors with few genetic aberrations, we developed an integrated genetic/epigenetic analysis method and applied it to 241 deep whole-genome sequencing profiles of 95 patients with Ewing sarcoma and 31 patients with other pediatric sarcomas. We achieved sensitive detection and classification of circulating tumor DNA in peripheral blood independent of any genetic alterations. We evaluated different metrics for cell-free DNA fragmentation analysis and developed LIQUORICE, a bioinformatic tool for detecting circulating tumor DNA based on tumor-specific chromatin structure. Using machine learning methods, we combined several fragmentation-based metrics into an integrated approach for liquid biopsy analysis tailored to cancers with low mutation rates but widespread epigenetic deregulation. Clinical associations highlighted the potential value of cfDNA fragmentation patterns as prognostic biomarkers in Ewing sarcoma. 
Additionally, we performed low coverage whole-genome-sequencing on 43 tumor biopsy samples from patients with Ewing sarcoma, in order to compare copy number aberrations detected in cell-free DNA and biopsy samples of the same patients. For validation of the epigenetic signatures inferred from cell-free DNA, we further performed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) on 38 matched biopsy samples from patients with Ewing sarcoma. 
In summary, our study provides a comprehensive analysis of circulating tumor DNA beyond recurrent somatic mutations, and it renders the benefits of liquid biopsy more readily accessible for childhood cancers."
EGAS00001004702,chromosomal copy number heterogeneity predicts survival rates  cancers,"Survival rates of cancer patients vary widely within and between malignancies. While genetic aberrations are at the root of all cancers, individual genomic features cannot explain these distinct disease outcomes. In contrast, intra-tumour heterogeneity (ITH) has the potential to elucidate pan-cancer survival rates and the biology that drives cancer prognosis1,2. Unfortunately, a comprehensive and effective framework to measure ITH across cancers is missing3. Here, we introduce a scalable measure of chromosomal copy number heterogeneity that predicts patient survival across cancers. We show that the level of ITH can be derived from a single-sample copy number profile. Using gene-expression data we demonstrate that ongoing chromosomal instability underlies the observed heterogeneity. Analysing 11,534 primary cancer samples from 35 different malignancies, we find that copy number heterogeneity can be accurately deduced and predicts cancer survival across tissues of origin and stages of disease. Our results provide a unifying molecular explanation for the different survival rates observed between cancer types."

Using single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles of murine and human tissue Treg cells, we defined a species-conserved and microbiota-independent repair Treg signature, with a prevailing footprint of the transcription factor BATF. Combining this signature with gene expression profiling and TCR fate mapping, we identified a population of tissue-like Treg cells in peripheral blood, characterized by the expression of BATF, CCR8 and HLA-DR. Human BATF+CCR8+ Treg cells from normal skin and adipose tissue shared features with tumor-resident Treg and tissue T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells.

Despite the remarkable success of ICI immunotherapy, a significant proportion of patients whose tumors respond to these treatments develop immune-related adverse events (irAEs) resembling autoimmune diseases. Although the clinical spectrum of irAEs is well characterized, their successful management remains empiric. This is in part because the pathogenic mechanisms involved in the break-down of peripheral tolerance and induction of irAEs remain elusive. Herein, we focused on regulatory T cells (Tregs) in individuals with irAEs because these cells are vital for maintenance of peripheral tolerance, appear expanded in the peripheral blood of individuals with cancer and abundantly express checkpoint molecules, hence representing direct targets of ICI immunotherapy. Our data demonstrate an intense transcriptomic reprogramming of CD4+CD25+CD127– Tregs in the blood of individuals with advanced metastatic melanoma who develop irAEs following ICI immunotherapy, with a characteristic inflammatory, apoptotic and metabolic signature. This inflammatory signature was shared by Tregs from individuals with different types of cancer developing irAEs and individuals with autoimmune diseases. Our findings propose an inflammatory Treg reprogramming as a feature of immunotherapy-induced irAEs, that may facilitate translational approaches aiming to induce robust antitumor immunity without disturbing peripheral tolerance."

EGAS00001005174,sn rnaseq profiling   impact   cytokine storm model  human cardiac organoids,"We developed conditions to model conditions of diastolic dysfunction caused by inflammatory factors in human cardiac organoids. Our organoid model is based on conditions promoting maturation (Mills et al., PNAS, 2017 and Voges et al., In Revision) and incorporating human pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes, epicardial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and pericytes. Following 15 days of differentiation (Voges et al., Development, 2017) we formed human cardiac organoids incorporating both our multicellular differentiation (Mills et al., PNAS, 2017) and additional endothelial cells (Voges et al., In Revision). After another 12 days of maturation in 5 days maturation medium and 5 days weaning medium (Voges et al., In Revision) human cardiac organoids were either treated with weaning medium or “cardiac cytokine storm” comprised of  100 ng/ml IFNg, 10 ng/ml IL-1 β and 10 µg/ml poly(I:C). After 48 hours human cardiac organoids were harvested and snap frozen in -80C before nuclei isolation and single nuclei RNA sequencing.Pooled hCO (~40) were homogenized in 4 mL lysis buffer (300 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 8), 5 mM CaCl2, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT)(all Sigma-Aldrich) with 30 strokes of a dounce tissue grinder (Wheaton). Large pieces of hCO were allowed to settle and homogenate was passed through pre-wetted 40 µm cell strainers (Becton Dickinson). Remaining hCO material in the douncer was resuspended in 4 mL and the douncing and filtering steps were repeated twice. All steps of the homogenization were performed on ice. The filtered homogenate was centrifuged at 1500 x g for 5 min at 4oC. Nuclei pellets were then re-suspended in PBS. A fraction of resuspended nuclei were then stained with hoechst nuclear stain (1:500 dilution) and counted on a haemocytometer under fluorescent microscope.The nuclei were then re-centrifuged (1500 x g for 5 min at 4°C) and resuspended at a density to load ~5,000 nuclei per sample. Cell were loaded into the Chromium Controller (10X Genomics) for gel bead emulsion (GEM) formation. Library preparation was conducted according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3’ GEM, Library &amp; Gel Bead Kit v3.1. Libraries were sequenced on the NextSeq 500/550 v2 (Illumina) with 150 bp reads.In the snRNA-seq we note the lower than expected percentage of non-myocytes and the loss of endothelial cells (Mills et al., PNAS, 2017 and Voges et al., In Revision), indicating the protocol requires further optimization for hCO samples."

EGAS00001005182,pediatric papillary thyroid carcinoma rna seq,"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common malignancy amongst adolescent and young adult women. Clinical and genomic features of PTC in children differ from those in adults. Historically, a substantial proportion (~50%) of pediatric PTC (PPTC) lack any of the common driver mutations typical of adult PTC. Thus, molecular diagnostics developed for adults may not be valid in children. We applied novel bioinformatic pipelines to RNASeq analysis of pediatric thyroid tumors to identify known and novel fusion oncogenes as drivers of tumorigenesis and to define gene expression patterns among tumors. Analysis of 38 samples resulted in identification of 16 previously reported oncogenic fusions and three novel candidate fusions. In conducting these analyses, we reduced the proportion of cancers with unknown drivers from approximately 50% to 6%. Gene expression analysis identified three distinct categories of tumors. These studies represent the first unbiased genomic approach to childhood PTC. Novel bioinformatic pipeline.  
GEC Identified 3 distinct classes. DICER1, PTEN segregated with benign tumors. 
&gt;90% of PPTC carry identifiable ongognic driver variants, however, the landscape differs from that in adults and existing tools for tumor genotyping in adults may not be applicable to pediatric tumors.  
BACKGROUND: Papillary thyroid carcinoma demonstrates clinically distinct behaviour in pediatric patients when compared to adults, with increased regional and distal metastases, more frequent recurrence, yet overall highly favourable prognosis. Recent tumor genotyping has demonstrated that in pediatric tumors, ***-*** do not carry the most common genomic variants found in adult PTC, leaving a substantial proportion of driver-unknown or “dark matter” tumors.  
METHODS: We established a cohort of 52 pediatric PTC and performed quantitative-PCR genotyping followed in a subset by whole exome and whole transcriptome (RNASeq) sequencing using a novel, robust bioinformatic pipeline to identify oncogenic fusion transcripts. Gene expression analysis was used to derive distinct clusters. 
RESULTS: In 52 pediatric PTC, genotyping identified BRAFV600E(21%), NRASQ61R(2%), RET/PTC1 (21%), RET/PTC3 (17%) or PAX8-PPAR in 33 (63%) of tumors. Among the remaining 19 tumors, oncogenic variants were identified in /19 (%). The variants included SNVs in DICER1, ETV6-NTRK3, PTEN and 9 additional oncogenic fusions including two previously-undescribed fusion transcripts, *** and ***.  
CONCLUSIONS: The genomic landscape of PTC differs between children and adults. In children, there is a substantial fraction of tumors that are unexplained by variants typical of adult PTC. This discrepancy is explained largely by uncommon oncogenic fusions which can be identified by whole-transcriptome analysis."

EGAS00001005187,pediatric papillary thyroid carcinoma  exome sequencing,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric papillary thyroid carcinoma (PPTC) is distinct from adult-onset disease. Despite higher rates of regional and distal metastases and more frequent recurrence, there is, paradoxically, a highly favourable prognosis. Historically, only 40-50% of childhood PTC are driven by genomic variants common to adult PTC, while the oncogenic drivers in the remainder are unknown.  
METHODS: Fifty-two PPTCs were genotyped by candidate gene testing, followed, in a subset (n=32), by whole exome (WES) and transcriptome sequencing (RNASeq) to identify oncogenic variants in driver-unknown tumors and to explore gene expression patterns. 
FINDINGS: Thirty-one tumors (60%) carried variants identified by candidate gene testing, specifically: BRAFV600E(22%), NRASQ61R(2%), RET-CCDC6(19%), RET-NCOA4(15%) and PAX8-PPARG. Among the 21 remaining tumors with negative first-line genotyping, oncogenic variants were identified in 19 (90%). These were enriched with oncogenic fusions, with 11 non-recurrent fusion transcripts identified, including two that had not been previously described: STRN-RET and TG-PBF. Most fusions were associated with 3’ receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) moieties: RET, MET, ALK and NTRK3. Gene expression analysis defined three distinct clusters, which demonstrated differing expression of genes involved in thyroid differentiation and MAPK signaling.  
INTERPRETATION: Exome and transcriptome-wide sequencing identify genomic drivers of PPTC in 98% of tumors, whereas conventional genotyping leaves many tumors genetically unexplained. PPTC is driven, in the majority of cases, by oncogenic fusion transcripts involving one of a limited number of RTKs. These observations have broad implications for diagnostic testing and for therapeutic options in children with advanced disease."

relationship with thrombosis are ongoing healthcare challenges. Using plasma biomarkers
analysis coupled with the transcriptional and epigenetic characterisation of cell types
involved in thrombosis, obtained from two extreme phenotype groups (obese and
lipodystrophy) and comparing these to lean individuals and blood donors, the present study
identifies the molecular mechanisms at play, highlighting patterns of abnormal activation in
innate immune phagocytic cells and shows that extreme phenotype groups could be
distinguished from lean individuals, and from each other, across all data layers. The
characterisation of the same obese group, six months after bariatric surgery shows the loss of
the patterns of abnormal activation of innate immune cells previously observed. However,
rather than reverting to the gene expression landscape of lean individuals, this occurs via the
establishment of novel gene expression landscapes. Netosis and its control mechanisms
emerge amongst the pathways that show an improvement after surgical intervention. Taken
together, by integrating across data layers, the observed molecular and metabolic differences
form a disease signature that is able to discriminate, amongst the blood donors, those
individuals with a higher likelihood of having cardiometabolic syndrome, even when not
presenting with the classic features."

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) combined with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of the immune features of MPM offers the prospect of identifying changes that could inform future clinical trials. We analysed somatic mutation and RNA-seq data from 229 MPM samples, including 58 MPM samples that had undergone WGS from our own institutions, together with other published data. This combined analysis identified somatic driver genes, including newly identified candidate genes. Whole genome doubling was a frequent event that correlated with shorter survival. Mutational signature analysis revealed dominant signatures and showed that defects in homologous recombination repair were infrequent in our cohort. Within the tumour immune environment we identified high M2 macrophage infiltrate linked with MMP2, MMP14, TGFB1 and CCL2 expression, representing an immunosuppressive environment. A small subset of samples had a higher proportion of CD8 T cells and a high cytolytic score, suggesting a ‘hot’ immune environment which is independent of the somatic mutations. We propose that our findings on genomic changes and subtypes of immune microenvironments may influence therapeutic planning in the future."

In this study, we assess the performance of messenger RNA (mRNA) capture sequencing to identify fusion transcripts in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue of different types of sarcoma, followed by orthogonal confirmation using RT-qPCR. To validate our workflow, we used the TruSight RNA Pan-Cancer Panel to analyze a first cohort of 6 positive control tumors for which the diagnostic workup demonstrated the presence of a specific chromosomal rearrangement. Fusion transcript calling by FusionCatcher confirmed all known aberrations and enabled the identification of both fusion gene partners and breakpoints. Next, whole transcriptome TruSeq RNA Exome sequencing was applied to a second cohort of 17 patients, diagnosed with fusion gene-negative alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) or undifferentiated round cell sarcoma (URCS), for whom fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) did not identify the classical pathognomonic rearrangements. Remarkably, for 6 out of 17 patients, mRNA capture sequencing readily detected a pathognomonic fusion transcript, i.e. PAX3-FOXO1 in 2 ARMS patients, and EWSR1-FLI1, EWSR1-ERG or EWSR1-NFATC2 in 4 URCS patients. These data show that RNA capture sequencing may enhance the detection rate of pathognomonic fusion genes in sarcoma. For the 11 patients with no known pathognomonic fusion transcript, 11 newly identified fusion transcripts were confirmed by RT-qPCR, including COPS3-TOM1L2, NCOA1-DTNB, WWTR1-LINC01986, PLAA-MOB3B, AP1B1-CHEK2 and BRD4-LEUTX fusion transcripts in ARMS patients. Additionally, recurrently detected secondary fusion transcripts in two patients diagnosed with EWSR1-NFATC2-positive sarcoma were confirmed (COPS4-TBC1D9, PICALM-SYTL2, SMG6-VPS53 and UBE2F-ALS2).

A fundamental task underlying these applications is the SNV calling from cfDNA, which, however, faces a new challenge, namely, the generally very low tumor content in cfDNA. Thus all existing callers fail to achieve satisfactory performance. Here we present cfSNV, a method incorporating multi-layer error suppression and hierarchical mutation calling, to address this important challenge. Furthermore, by leveraging cfDNA’s  comprehensive coverage of clonal landscape, for the first time cfSNV can profile mutations even in subclones. In both simulated and real patient data, cfSNV vastly outperforms existing tools, showing tens of times increase in sensitivity in detecting mutations with low allele frequency while maintaining high precision. cfSNV can enhance the clinical utilities of cfDNA by dramatically reducing the required sequencing depth and therefore reduce the cost by magnitudes, and further make the Whole-Exome-Sequencing of cfDNA a viable option.  As an example, we demonstrate that cfDNA-WES allows a new biomarker to effectively select patients for immunotherapy."

Led by Mike Stratton, together with Paul Brennan, Ludmil Alexandrov, Allan Balmain, David Phillips and Peter Campbell, this large-scale international research endeavour was awarded a Cancer Research UK Grand Challenge. 

Different patterns of somatic mutation are generated by the different environmental, lifestyle and genetic factors that cause cancer, many of them are still unknown. Within Mutographs, the International Agency for Research on Cancer is coordinating the recruitment of 5000 individuals with cancer (colorectal, renal, pancreatic, oesophageal adenocarcinoma or oesophageal squamous cancers) across 5 continents to explore whether different mutational signatures explain marked variation in incidence. In brief, through an international network of collaborators around the world, biological materials are collected, along with demographic, histological, clinical and questionnaire data. Whole genome sequences of tumour-germline DNA pairs are generated at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. Somatic mutational signatures are subsequently extracted by non-negative matrix factorisation methods and correlated with risk factors data. 
Through an enhanced understanding of cancer aetiology, Mutographs unprecedented effort is anticipated to outline modifiable risk factors, lead to new approaches to prevent cancer, and provide opportunities to empower early detection, refine high-risk groups and contribute to further therapeutic development."

Pathologists distinguish between different BE stages to identify high-risk patients, but this process remains difficult as stage-specific markers are still missing. We established BE organoid cultures, applied single cell sequencing approaches to identify differences in gene expression and genomic alterations, and validated candidate genes for their predictive value on histological sections. Methods: We collected 43 epithelial biopsies from 21 patients, established organoids for the clonal expansion of matching healthy and diseased tissue from two patients to identify genomic alterations by whole genome sequencing (WGS). We performed single cell DNA-sequencing (scDNAseq) to analyse DNA alterations within biopsies from 8 patients and single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) to identify gene expression differences between BE stages from 19 patients. Candidate marker genes were then validated by RNA in situ hybridization experiments on histological resection specimen. Results: Most BE biopsies were chromosomal stable (CS) and their single base substitution (SBS) signatures were indistinguishable from the healthy control tissues. Dysplastic BE cells contained areas of chromosomal instabilities (CIN), which differed by the presence of the SBS17 signatures from biopsy-matching CS cells or patient-matching healthy control cells. Such CIN areas affected efficient clustering of the scRNAseq data. We identified two sets of marker genes (SLC5A5, PSCA, LIPF and ANPEP, CEACAM6, REG4), which distinguish columnar BE epithelium from non-dysplastic/dysplastic stages. CLDN2 allowed the distinction between dysplastic and more advanced stages as its expression level increased and spread in dysplastic BE glands. Conclusions: Molecular characterization of BE samples identified a correlation between the presence of CIN and COSMIC signature 17, and we report seven marker genes that help in distinguishing different BE stages."

Many of these previous studies ascertained COVID‑19 cases in medical clinics and hospitals, which can lead to an overrepresentation of cases with severe outcomes, such as hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, or ventilation. Here, we demonstrate the utility and validity of deep phenotyping with self-reported outcomes in a population with a large proportion of mild and subclinical cases. Using these data, we defined eight different phenotypes related to COVID‑19 outcomes: four that align with previously studied COVID‑19 definitions and four expanded definitions that focus on susceptibility given exposure, mild clinical manifestations, and an aggregate score of symptom severity. We assessed replication of 12 previously identified COVID‑19 genetic associations with all eight phenotypes in a trans-ancestry meta-analysis of European (EUR), Admixed Amerindian (LAT), Admixed African-European (AA) cohorts, and found distinct patterns of association, most notably related to the chr3/SLC6A20/LZTFL1 and chr9/ABO regions. Additionally, we performed a genome-wide analysis, which suggested certain expanded phenotypes may capture more protective associations than the established phenotypes."

EGAS00001005220,novel optineurin frameshift insertion causing familial frontotemporal dementia  parkinsonism  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,"Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) is a common cause of Young Onset Dementia and has diverse clinical manifestations involving behaviour, executive function, language and motor function, including parkinsonism. Up to 50% of FTD patients report a positive family history, supporting a strong genetic basis, particularly in cases with both FTD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD-ALS). Mutations in three genes are associated with the majority of familial FTD (fFTD) cases - microtubule associated protein tau gene (MAPT), progranulin gene (PGRN), and hexanucleotide repeat expansions in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72), whilst mutations in other genes such as optineurin (OPTN) have rarely been reported. Mutations in OPTN have been reported mostly in familial and sporadic cases of ALS, or in rare cases of FTD-ALS, but not in association with pure or predominant FTD and/or parkinsonian phenotype. Here, we report for the first time, a family from the Philippines with 4 affected members harbouring the same OPTN frameshift insertion, presenting with FTD-related phenotypes, including one sibling with predominant parkinsonism resembling corticobasal syndrome. Notably, none of the affected members showed any evidence of motor neuron disease or ALS at the time of writing, both clinically and on electrophysiological testing, expanding the phenotypic spectrum of OPTN mutations. Close follow-up of mutation carriers for the development of new clinical features and wider investigation of additional family members with further genetic analyses will be conducted to investigate the possibility of other genetic modifiers in this family which could explain phenotypic heterogeneity."

Our molecular characterization revealed higher rates of ACVR2A mutations (10%) – a potential tumour suppressor, presence of a novel mutational signature (MutSig-NASH-HCC), a more relevant role of Wnt/TGF-β proliferation subclass in tumours (42%) and immunosuppressive traits in the adjacent non-tumoral tissue."
EGAS00001005130,rna seq  vocal fold fibroblasts  reinke  edema  control subjects,"The voice disorder Reinke’s edema (RE) is a smoking- and voice-abuse associated benign lesion of the vocal folds, defined by an edema of the Reinke space, accompanied with pathological microvasculature changes and immune cell infiltration. Vocal fold fibroblasts (VFF) are the main cell type of the lamina propria and play a key role in the disease progression. Current therapy is restricted to symptomatic treatment. Hence, there is an urgent need for a better understanding of the molecular causes of the disease. In the present study, we investigated differential expression profiles of RE and control VFF by means of RNA sequencing. In addition, fast gene set enrichment analysis (FGSEA) was performed in order to obtain involved biological processes, mRNA and protein levels of targets of interest were further evaluated. We identified 74 differentially regulated genes in total, 19 of which were upregulated and 55 downregulated. Differential expression analysis and FGSEA revealed upregulated genes and pathways involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, inflammation and fibrosis. Downregulated genes and pathways were involved in ECM degradation, cell cycle control and proliferation. The current study addressed for the first time a direct comparison of VFF from RE to control and evaluated immediate functional consequences."
